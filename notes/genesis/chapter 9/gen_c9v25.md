### **GENESIS 9:25**

_Scroll of Noaḥ_  
(Traditional Genesis 9:25)  
**The Curse of Kenaʿan**

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And he said: “Cursed be Kenaʿan! A servant of servants shall he be to his brothers.”**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וַיֹּאמֶר  
אָרוּר כְּנָעַן  
עֶבֶד עֲבָדִים יִהְיֶה לְאֶחָיו

---

#### Transliteration:

_Vayyomer:  
ʾArur Kenaʿan,  
ʿeved ʿavadim yihyeh le’eḥav._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And he said, Cursed be Chanaan, a servant shall he be to his brethren.”

> LXX mirrors MT but simplifies “servant of servants” to “a servant,” retaining the judgment while slightly softening the superlative.

---

#### DSS (4QGen):

Aligns with MT. The key phrase **עֶבֶד עֲבָדִים (ʿeved ʿavadim)** is preserved — a Hebrew idiom for **utter subjugation**.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

#### **“Cursed be Kenaʿan…” (אָרוּר כְּנָעַן)**

- The curse **falls on the son**, not directly on Ḥam
    

> This is **not arbitrary** — it reflects:

- **Legal inheritance of shame** in covenant families
    
- Possibly that **Kenaʿan** was involved or emblematic of Ḥam’s dishonor
    
- Why Kenaʿan?
    
    - Literary emphasis (v. 18, 22) has pointed toward him
        
    - Prophetic foresight: Kenaʿan’s descendants will **oppose YHWH’s covenant people**, and **fall under judgment** (e.g., Joshua 6–11)
        

> This is not racism — it’s **covenantal justice and prophetic foresight**

---

#### **“Servant of servants…” (עֶבֶד עֲבָדִים)**

- A Hebrew idiom meaning **lowest of the low**
    
- Used similarly in **Deuteronomy 28:43–44**, to describe national humiliation
    

> Kenaʿan will not merely serve — he will be **subjugated beneath other servants**

---

#### **“To his brothers” (לְאֶחָיו)**

- Refers to the descendants of **Shem and Yephet**, his **familial equals**, now elevated
    

> This is both **prophetic and judicial** — forecasting geopolitical and spiritual roles in world history

---

### Covenant Context:

- Noaḥ’s role here is not simply emotional — he speaks as a **patriarch and prophet**
    
- His words become **binding declarations** shaping the **destinies of nations**
    

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- **Misappropriated interpretations** have falsely applied this verse to justify **racial slavery** — an abuse the text never supports
    

> The curse is **not racial**, **not absolute**, and **not based on skin or ethnicity** — it is **covenant-based**, **prophetic**, and tied to **specific future transgressions**

---

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

- **Shortly after AM 1662**, following Noaḥ’s recovery and assessment of the dishonor committed
    

---

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And he said, Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren.”

**YLT:**  
“And saith: Cursed [is] Canaan, Servant of servants he is to his brethren.”

**NIV:**  
“He said, ‘Cursed be Canaan! The lowest of slaves will he be to his brothers.’”

> KJV and YLT preserve **Hebraic weight**. NIV conveys meaning but uses **“lowest of slaves,”** which loses the **cultural-legal depth** of the idiom.

---

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

- **Genesis 10:15–19** — Kenaʿan’s descendants include **Sidon, Ḥeth, the Yebusi, Emori, Girgashi…** — the very peoples Israel will later confront
    
- **Deuteronomy 7:1–2** — “When YHWH brings you into the land of the Kenaʿani…” — prophetic curse fulfilled through conquest
    
- **Galatians 3:13** — “Messiah redeemed us from the curse…” — even those under a generational curse may be **redeemed in the New Covenant**
    

> Genesis 9:25 is the **first patriarchal curse** — but not one of hopeless condemnation. It is a **just verdict**, rooted in shame, aimed at a people who will eventually **oppose the line of promise**.
