### **GENESIS 9:21**

_Scroll of Noaḥ_  
(Traditional Genesis 9:21)  
**Noaḥ’s Nakedness and the Fall After the Flood**

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And he drank of the wine, and became drunk, and uncovered himself inside his tent.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וַיֵּשְׁתְּ מִן־הַיַּיִן  
וַיִּשְׁכָּר  
וַיִּתְגַּל בְּתוֹךְ אָהֳלוֹ

---

#### Transliteration:

_Vayeshet min-hayyayin,  
vayyishkar,  
vayyitgal betokh ohalo._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And he drank of the wine, and was drunk, and was naked in his house.”

> The LXX mirrors the MT’s structure but renders “tent” more broadly as “house” — possibly generalizing the setting.

---

#### DSS (4QGen):

Consistent with MT. The sequence of **drinking → drunkenness → exposure** is intact.

---

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

#### **“He drank of the wine…” (וַיֵּשְׁתְּ מִן־הַיַּיִן)**

- First recorded **use of wine in Scripture** — here, immediately tied to **intoxication and shame**
    

> Noaḥ’s intent isn’t condemned, but the outcome reveals **the frailty of even the righteous under ease and excess**

---

#### **“And became drunk…” (וַיִּשְׁכָּר)**

- **שָׁכַר (shakar)** — to be intoxicated, inebriated
    

> Same root used negatively in warnings throughout Scripture (e.g., Proverbs 20:1)

> This is not celebratory — the tone is sober, almost tragic

---

#### **“And uncovered himself in the midst of his tent” (וַיִּתְגַּל בְּתוֹךְ אָהֳלוֹ)**

- **וַיִּתְגַּל (vayyitgal)** — reflexive passive: **he uncovered himself / became uncovered**
    

> Possibly unconscious or semi-conscious, but the text leaves open the degree of intentionality

- **“In the midst of his tent”** — private, but not immune to consequence
    

> Suggests a space of **vulnerability**, now entered by others (see v. 22)

---

### Literary and Thematic Significance:

- This scene **mirrors the Fall of Adam**:
    
    - **Fruit → sin → shame → covering**
        
    - Eden had a **garden**, Noaḥ plants a **vineyard**
        
    - Adam was **naked and covered**, so is Noaḥ
        

> The parallels are intentional: this is a **second fall**, within the new world

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Many soften this account as mere carelessness or accident. The structure of the text suggests a **moral warning**:
    
    - Noaḥ, who walked with God, **lets down his guard**
        
    - His shame opens the door to **family disorder and generational consequence**
        

> This is not just a domestic incident — it’s a **spiritual unraveling**, echoing the pattern of Genesis 3.

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

- Estimated **AM 1660–1662**, after vines mature, wine is made, and events unfold
    

---

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered within his tent.”

**YLT:**  
“And he drinketh of the wine, and is drunken, and uncovereth himself in the midst of the tent.”

**NIV:**  
“When he drank some of its wine, he became drunk and lay uncovered inside his tent.”

> KJV and YLT capture the **Hebrew progression** and gravity. NIV makes it readable but removes nuance.

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

- **Genesis 3:6–7** — Adam and Ḥavvah’s eyes opened after sin, and they knew they were naked
    
- **Proverbs 23:31–33** — warnings about wine leading to shame and twisted vision
    
- **1 Corinthians 10:12** — “Let him who thinks he stands take heed lest he fall”
    

> Genesis 9:21 reminds us that **even those who walk with God can fall** — not in judgment this time, but in **shame, vulnerability, and legacy**.
