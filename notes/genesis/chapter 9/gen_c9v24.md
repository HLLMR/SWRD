### **GENESIS 9:24**

_Scroll of Noaḥ_  
(Traditional Genesis 9:24)  
**Noaḥ Awakens to Shame**

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And Noaḥ awoke from his wine, and he knew what his younger son had done to him.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וַיִּיקֶץ נֹחַ מִיֵּינוֹ  
וַיֵּדַע  
אֵת אֲשֶׁר עָשָׂה־לוֹ  
בְּנוֹ הַקָּטָן

---

#### Transliteration:

_Vayyiqetz Noaḥ mi’yeino,  
vayyedaʿ  
et asher ʿasah-lo  
bno ha’qaṭan._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And Noah awoke from the wine, and knew all that his younger son had done to him.”

> LXX confirms the Hebrew’s structure — specifically identifying Ḥam (the “younger” son) and acknowledging **deliberate action**.

---

#### DSS (4QGen):

Matches MT — including the phrase **“his younger son”**, showing familial position is critical to understanding the judgment that follows.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

#### **“Noaḥ awoke from his wine…” (וַיִּיקֶץ מִיֵּינוֹ)**

- **יקץ (yaqetz)** — to awaken, often **with sudden realization or clarity**
    
- **מִיֵּינוֹ (mi’yeino)** — from his wine, implying **intoxication had fully passed**
    

> Noaḥ is no longer unaware — he now **discerns both event and intent**

---

#### **“And he knew what his younger son had done…”**

- **וַיֵּדַע (vayyedaʿ)** — not just intellectual awareness, but **relational and moral comprehension**
    

> Suggests divine insight or **recounted evidence from Shem and Yephet**

- **“His younger son” (בְּנוֹ הַקָּטָן)** — often interpreted as **Ḥam**, though some note that Kenaʿan is mentioned later
    

> Most consistent reading: Ḥam is the **younger of the three** (cf. Genesis 10:21, depending on ordering)

---

### What Was “Done”?

- The verb **עָשָׂה (ʿasah)** — to do, act, perform
    

> Not mere **seeing** but an **action** taken

- Context suggests:
    
    - He **saw**
        
    - He **told**
        
    - He **mocked** or **dishonored** — leading to **moral damage**, not physical violence
        

> The text frames this not as a **criminal act**, but a **spiritual breach**: failure to **honor, cover, protect**

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Speculations about sexual impropriety or incest arise from later Levitical usage of “uncovering nakedness” — but nothing in the text **requires or supports that reading here**
    

> The sin here is **dishonor**, not assault. What Ḥam “did” was **exploit, shame, and expose** his father for personal amusement or pride.

---

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

- Still **circa AM 1660–1662**
    
- This verse begins the **verdict and curse sequence** of the narrative
    

---

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had done unto him.”

**YLT:**  
“And Noah awaketh from his wine, and knoweth that which his young son hath done to him,”

**NIV:**  
“When Noah awoke from his wine and found out what his youngest son had done to him…”

> All agree. KJV/YLT preserve **moral weight and ambiguity**. NIV simplifies “found out,” but slightly weakens the **narrative charge**.

---

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

- **Genesis 3:7** — Adam’s eyes were opened, and he knew he was naked
    
- **Proverbs 30:17** — “The eye that mocks a father… shall be plucked out…”
    
- **Exodus 20:12** — “Honor your father and mother…” — Ḥam violates this primal command
    

> Genesis 9:24 is not just about awakening from wine — it’s about awakening to **the fracture of legacy**, and the beginning of **covenantal judgment on the line of Kenaʿan**.
