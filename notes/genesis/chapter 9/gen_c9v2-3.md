### **GENESIS 9:2–3**

_Scroll of Noaḥ_  
(Traditional Genesis 9:2–3)  
**Dominion and Diet: A New Order**

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**2.** And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every bird of the heavens — in all that moves on the ground, and in all the fish of the sea — into your hand are they given.  
**3.** Every moving thing that lives shall be for you as food — just as I gave you the green plant, I have now given you everything.

#### Hebrew (MT):

**2**  
וּמוֹרַאֲכֶם  
וְחִתְּכֶם  
יִהְיֶה עַל כָּל־חַיַּת הָאָרֶץ  
וְעַל כָּל־עוֹף הַשָּׁמָיִם  
בְּכֹל אֲשֶׁר תִּרְמֹשׂ הָאֲדָמָה  
וּבְכָל דְּגֵי הַיָּם  
בְּיֶדְכֶם נִתָּנוּ

**3**  
כָּל־רֶמֶשׂ אֲשֶׁר הוּא חַי  
לָכֶם יִהְיֶה לְאָכְלָה  
כְּיֶרֶק עֵשֶׂב נָתַתִּי לָכֶם אֶת־כֹּל

#### Transliteration:

**2**  
_U’mora’akhem  
ve’ḥittekhem  
yihyeh ʿal kol ḥayat ha’aretz,  
veʿal kol ʿof hashamayim,  
bekhol asher tirmos ha’adamah,  
u’vekhol degei hayam —  
beyedkhem nittanu._

**3**  
_Kol remes asher hu ḥai  
lakhem yihyeh le’okhlah —  
keyerek ʿesev,  
natatti lakhem et kol._

#### LXX (Brenton):

**2.** “And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon all the beasts of the earth… and upon all the fishes of the sea: into your hands are they delivered.  
**3.** And every reptile which is living shall be to you for meat; I have given all things to you as the green herbs.”

> The LXX agrees closely and emphasizes **universal dominion and dietary provision**.

---

#### DSS (4QGen):

Consistent with MT. The dual phrases “fear and dread” and the universal scope of dominion are intact.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

#### **Verse 2 — “Fear and dread of you shall be upon every beast…”**

- **מוֹרָא (moraʾ)** — fear, reverence
    
- **חִתָּה (ḥittah)** — dread, terror, awe-inspiring panic
    

> These are **strong terms** — the animal kingdom now regards mankind not only as master but as **a source of danger**.

- Dominion is reaffirmed (cf. Genesis 1:28), but now it includes **predatory tension**.
    

> Pre-Flood harmony is replaced with **post-Flood caution** — a fractured relationship remains between mankind and creation.

---

**“…into your hand they are given” (בְּיֶדְכֶם נִתָּנוּ)**

- This is a **reaffirmation of delegated authority**
    
- Echoes Genesis 1:26–28, but now with **conflict implicit** in the transfer
    

> Man is no longer just caretaker — he is **ruler in a fallen world**.

---

#### **Verse 3 — “Every moving thing that lives shall be food for you…”**

- A major shift: this is the **first divine authorization for eating meat**.
    
- Pre-Flood diet (Genesis 1:29–30) was **plant-based** — now **flesh is permitted**, likely due to:
    
    - Post-Flood ecological changes
        
    - Necessity of protein
        
    - Reinforcement of mankind’s dominion
        

> Divine concession, not divine ideal — but not forbidden.

---

**“Just as I gave you the green plant, I have now given you everything”**

- Direct allusion to Genesis 1:29:
    
    - “I have given you every herb yielding seed…”
        

> The grammar is deliberate: meat is now **added**, not replacing vegetation — indicating **a broader permission, not a replacement rule**.

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Some traditions teach that eating meat was always permitted — this verse clearly contradicts that.
    
- Others claim this was a sin concession — but the text presents it as a **divine provision, not rebuke**.
    

> This is a **post-Flood adjustment** in light of a new, harsher world — both judgment and mercy shaping reality.

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

- **27th day of the 2nd month, AM 1657**
    
- Within days of the post-Flood covenantal declaration

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
2. “And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast… into your hand are they delivered.”  
3. “Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you…”

**YLT:**  
2. “And your fear and your dread is on every beast… into your hand they have been given.”  
3. “Every creeping thing that is alive, to you it is for food…”

**NIV:**  
2. “The fear and dread of you will fall on all the beasts… they are given into your hands.”  
3. “Everything that lives and moves about will be food for you…”

> KJV and YLT retain the **theological gravity**; NIV renders clearly but with less nuance.

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

- **Genesis 1:28–30** — pre-Flood command and vegetarian provision
    
- **Leviticus 11** — later dietary distinctions introduced for **clean and unclean animals**, but here all are allowed
    
- **Acts 10:13–15** — “What God has cleansed, call not common” — echoes this verse’s foundational liberty
    

> Genesis 9:2–3 reflects a shift in the relationship between man and creation — dominion is kept, but now **shadowed by fear**, and sustained by **a broader diet** in a fallen world.
