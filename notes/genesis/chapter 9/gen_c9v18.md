### **GENESIS 9:18**

_Scroll of Noaḥ_  
(Traditional Genesis 9:18)  
**The Sons of Noaḥ and the Origin of Nations**

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And the sons of Noaḥ who went out of the ark were Shem, and Ḥam, and Yephet; and Ḥam — he is the father of Kenaʿan.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וַיִּהְיוּ בְנֵי־נֹחַ  
הַיֹּצְאִים מִן־הַתֵּבָה  
שֵׁם וְחָם וְיָפֶת  
וְחָם הוּא אֲבִי כְנָעַן

---

#### Transliteration:

_Vayyihyu venei-Noaḥ  
ha’yotze’im min-hatevah —  
Shem, ve’Ḥam, ve’Yephet;  
ve’Ḥam hu avi Kenaʿan._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And the sons of Noe who came out of the ark were Sem, Cham, and Japheth; and Cham was the father of Chanaan.”

> The LXX agrees closely with MT and maintains the **parenthetical note** about Ḥam’s son, **Kenaʿan**, setting up the narrative tension ahead.

---

#### DSS (4QGen):

Fully aligns with MT, including the emphasis on **Ḥam as father of Kenaʿan**, a marker of prophetic foreshadowing.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“And the sons of Noaḥ who went out of the ark…”**

- This verse serves as a **narrative bridge** between the global covenant and the reestablishment of family lines
    
- Repetition of the three sons:
    
    - **Shem** — line of blessing (Messiah through Eber and Abraham)
        
    - **Ḥam** — line of trouble (through Kenaʿan and Mitsrayim)
        
    - **Yephet** — line of expansion and Gentile nations
        

---

**“Ḥam — he is the father of Kenaʿan”**

- This parenthetical note is critical: **Kenaʿan** will be cursed in the next section (v. 25), but his guilt is **tied to Ḥam’s actions**
    

> This is **not a minor genealogical footnote** — it is a prophetic marker, meant to draw **legal and narrative attention** to what follows.

---

### Literary and Thematic Setup:

- The structure signals that **the Flood is over**, and now **the nations will emerge** through these three sons
    
- The unique highlighting of Ḥam as Kenaʿan’s father indicates:
    
    - The narrator expects the reader to **watch that line closely**
        
    - This is not about all of Ḥam’s descendants, but **specifically about Kenaʿan’s future role**
        

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Historically, some have misused this passage to justify racial hierarchy — but the text **does not curse Ḥam** or all his children, only **Kenaʿan**, and only **in response to a specific incident**.
    

> This verse **introduces a legal line of accountability**, not a blanket ethnic judgment.

---

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

- Still **late 2nd month to early 3rd month, AM 1657**
    
- Immediately following the covenant — this verse transitions to the **settling and division of post-Flood humanity**

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And the sons of Noah, that went forth of the ark, were Shem, and Ham, and Japheth: and Ham is the father of Canaan.”

**YLT:**  
“And the sons of Noah who are going out of the ark are Shem, and Ham, and Japheth; and Ham — he is father of Canaan.”

**NIV:**  
“The sons of Noah who came out of the ark were Shem, Ham and Japheth. Ham was the father of Canaan.”

> All agree. YLT best preserves the **Hebrew emphasis** of the final clause.

---

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

- **Genesis 5:32** — the sons of Noaḥ first named
    
- **Genesis 10:6–20** — descendants of Ḥam, especially Kenaʿan’s line
    
- **Deuteronomy 7:1–2** — Israel’s conquest of Kenaʿan as a fulfillment of the prophetic curse begun here
    

> Genesis 9:18 marks the **beginning of the genealogical and moral unraveling** that will define the next phase of the biblical story — **from covenant to conflict**.
