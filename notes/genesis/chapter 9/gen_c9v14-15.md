_Scroll of Noaḥ_  
(Traditional Genesis 9:14–15)  
**YHWH Remembers His Covenant**

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**14.** And it shall come to pass, when I bring clouds over the earth, and the bow is seen in the cloud,  
**15.** then I will remember My covenant, which is between Me and you and every living soul of all flesh; and the waters shall never again become a flood to destroy all flesh.

#### Hebrew (MT):

**14**  
וְהָיָה בְּעַנְנִי עָנָן עַל־הָאָרֶץ  
וְנִרְאֲתָה הַקֶּשֶׁת בֶּעָנָן

**15**  
וְזָכַרְתִּי אֶת־בְּרִיתִי  
אֲשֶׁר בֵּינִי וּבֵינֵיכֶם  
וּבֵין כָּל־נֶפֶשׁ חַיָּה בְּכָל־בָּשָׂר  
וְלֹא־יִהְיֶה עוֹד הַמַּיִם  
לְמַבּוּל לְשַׁחֵת כָּל־בָּשָׂר

#### Transliteration:

**14**  
_Ve’hayah beʿaneni ʿanan ʿal ha’aretz,  
ve’nirʾatah haqeshet beʿanan._

**15**  
_Ve’zakharti et-beriti  
asher beini u’veineikhem  
u’vein kol nefesh ḥayyah bekhol basar,  
ve’lo yihyeh ʿod hamayim  
le’mabbul le’shaḥet kol basar._

#### LXX (Brenton):

**14.** “And it shall be, when I gather clouds upon the earth, that My bow shall be seen in the cloud.  
**15.** And I will remember My covenant, which is between Me and you and every living soul in all flesh; and there shall no more be water for a flood, so as to destroy all flesh.”

> The LXX preserves the **divine self-reminder** theme and confirms that **destruction by flood is permanently ruled out**.

---

#### DSS (4QGen):

Fully consistent with MT. The phrasing **“I will remember My covenant” (וְזָכַרְתִּי אֶת־בְּרִיתִי)** is preserved intact — showing divine memory is **triggered by visible sign**.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

#### **Verse 14 — “When I bring clouds over the earth…”**

- **בְּעַנְנִי (beʿaneni)** — “when I cloud” or “when I cover with clouds”
    

> The image is of **divine activity** — not random weather, but **a storm under God’s hand**

- **“The bow is seen in the cloud”**
    

> A moment of tension: **judgment seems near**, but instead, a **sign of mercy appears**

> In the same skies that once poured wrath, YHWH now **sets a covenantal restraint**

---

#### **Verse 15 — “Then I will remember My covenant…”**

- **וְזָכַרְתִּי (vezakharti)** — “I will remember”
    

> Not implying forgetfulness, but a **commitment to action based on a prior vow**

- **“Which is between Me and you and every living soul…”**
    

> Repeats covenantal parties — **human and animal life**, without distinction

- **“The waters shall never again become a flood to destroy all flesh”**
    

> The verb **“become”** (יִהְיֶה) shows the **prevention of transformation** — water will **not be allowed** to rise to judgment again

---

### Covenant Mechanics:

- The bow is not for man’s memory alone — it is a **visible trigger for divine mercy**
    
- This makes it a **cosmic legal token** — when seen, YHWH Himself honors His promise
    

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Some reduce the bow to a human-oriented symbol. But the text is clear: **YHWH sets it, YHWH sees it, YHWH remembers**.
    

> The bow is not for us to signal back — it is a **divine act of grace directed toward creation**.

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

- **Late 2nd month, AM 1657**
    
- Continuation of YHWH’s covenantal address begun in 9:8

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
14. “And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow shall be seen…”  
15. “And I will remember My covenant… and the waters shall no more become a flood…”

**YLT:**  
14. “And it hath come to pass (in My sending a cloud over the earth) that the bow hath been seen…”  
15. “And I have remembered My covenant…”

**NIV:**  
14. “Whenever I bring clouds over the earth and the rainbow appears…”  
15. “I will remember my covenant… Never again will the waters become a flood to destroy all life.”

> KJV and YLT preserve **divine agency and legal tone**. NIV smooths for readability but weakens **covenantal nuance**.

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

- **Exodus 2:24** — “And God heard… and God remembered His covenant…” — **covenant remembrance = divine intervention**
    
- **Jeremiah 31:35–36** — YHWH’s covenant with nature ensures **the continuity of Israel and creation**
    
- **Luke 1:72** — “To remember His holy covenant…” — divine memory as the basis for **messianic fulfillment**
    

> Genesis 9:14–15 gives us not just a sign, but a **heavenly safeguard** — where divine memory is visually anchored in the world we see.
