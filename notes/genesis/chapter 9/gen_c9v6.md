### **GENESIS 9:6**

_Scroll of Noaḥ_  
(Traditional Genesis 9:6)  
**Divine Justice: Blood for Blood**

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**Whoever sheds the blood of man, by man shall his blood be shed — for in the image of Elohim He made man.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

שֹׁפֵךְ דַּם הָאָדָם  
בָּאָדָם דָּמוֹ יִשָּׁפֵךְ  
כִּי בְּצֶלֶם אֱלֹהִים  
עָשָׂה אֶת־הָאָדָם

---

#### Transliteration:

_Shofekh dam ha’adam  
ba’adam damo yishafekh —  
ki be’tzelem Elohim  
ʿasah et-ha’adam._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“He that sheds man’s blood, instead of that blood shall his own be shed; for in the image of God I made man.”

> LXX preserves the moral logic: **the shedding of blood defiles the image** of Elohim and demands reckoning.

---

#### DSS (4QGen):

Fully supports MT structure. No deviations in core legal phrasing or theological foundation.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“Whoever sheds the blood of man…” (שֹׁפֵךְ דַּם הָאָדָם)**

- **שָׁפַךְ (shafakh)** — to pour out, spill, shed
    

> Not just homicide — any **unauthorized or unjust bloodshed**

- Note: the subject is **unqualified** — this applies to **all humanity**, not just Israelites or covenant people.
    

---

**“By man shall his blood be shed…” (בָּאָדָם דָּמוֹ יִשָּׁפֵךְ)**

- Divine establishment of **human justice**
    
- This is the first **legal mandate for capital punishment**
    

> The responsibility to judge and avenge blood lies **with man**, acting under divine law — not by personal vengeance, but by **communal justice**.

---

**“For in the image of Elohim He made man…”**

- Reinforces **Genesis 1:26–27** — man bears the divine image, so to kill him is to **assault YHWH’s representative** on earth
    

> The dignity of human life is rooted not in biology or utility, but in **divine likeness**

---

### Legal and Moral Implications:

- This is the foundation of **moral law**, **civil authority**, and the **concept of justice as sacred**.
    
- Even after the Fall and the Flood, the image of Elohim in man remains — broken, but not erased.
    

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Many modern theologians reject the idea of divinely sanctioned capital punishment, but this verse **institutes it directly**, grounded in the **sanctity of life and the nature of God**.
    
- This is **not mere retribution** — it’s **restorative justice**, acknowledging the **unique worth** of human beings.

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

- Delivered in the same speech as the commands to multiply, eat, and revere life

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“Whoso sheddeth man’s blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made he man.”

**YLT:**  
“Whoso sheddeth man’s blood, by man is his blood shed: for in the image of God hath He made man.”

**NIV:**  
“Whoever sheds human blood, by humans shall their blood be shed; for in the image of God has God made mankind.”

> All agree. KJV and YLT retain **judicial clarity**. NIV is gender-inclusive but loses singular gravitas.

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

- **Genesis 4:10–11** — Cain’s crime unpunished, but here the **principle of justice is established**.
    
- **Exodus 21:12** — “Whoever strikes a man so that he dies shall surely be put to death.”
    
- **Romans 13:4** — “He is the minister of God… a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil.”
    

> Genesis 9:6 reveals that justice is **not human invention**, but **divine commission** — grounded in the image of God, preserved in every soul.
