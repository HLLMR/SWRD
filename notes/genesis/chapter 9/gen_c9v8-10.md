#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**8.** And Elohim said to Noaḥ and to his sons with him, saying:  
**9.** “As for Me — behold, I establish My covenant with you and with your seed after you,  
**10.** and with every living creature that is with you — of the birds, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you, of all that go out of the ark — for every beast of the earth.”

#### Hebrew (MT):

**8**  
וַיֹּאמֶר אֱלֹהִים אֶל־נֹחַ  
וְאֶל־בָּנָיו אִתּוֹ לֵאמֹר

**9**  
וַאֲנִי הִנְנִי מֵקִים אֶת־בְּרִיתִי אִתְּכֶם  
וְאֶת־זַרְעֲכֶם אַחֲרֵיכֶם

**10**  
וְאֶת כָּל־נֶפֶשׁ הַחַיָּה אֲשֶׁר אִתְּכֶם  
בָּעוֹף בַּבְּהֵמָה  
וּבְכָל חַיַּת הָאָרֶץ אִתְּכֶם  
מִכֹּל יֹצְאֵי הַתֵּבָה  
לְכֹל חַיַּת הָאָרֶץ

#### Transliteration:

**8**  
_Vayyomer Elohim el-Noaḥ  
ve’el-banav ito le’mor:_

**9**  
_Va’ani hin’ni meqim et-beriti it’khem  
ve’et zarʿakhem aḥareikhem_

**10**  
_Ve’et kol-nefesh haḥayyah asher it’khem  
baʿof, ba’behemah,  
u’vekhol ḥayat ha’aretz it’khem  
mikkol yotzei hatevah  
le’khol ḥayat ha’aretz._

#### LXX (Brenton):

**8.** “And God spoke to Noah, and to his sons with him, saying,  
**9.** ‘And behold, I establish My covenant with you, and with your seed after you,  
**10.** and with every living creature with you — both birds and cattle and wild beasts of the earth — as many as came out of the ark.’”

> LXX closely mirrors MT. The covenant includes **all life**, not just humanity — emphasizing universal divine grace.

---

#### DSS (4QGen):

Faithfully reflects MT — especially the repeated use of **אִתְּכֶם (“with you”)**, showing **shared inclusion** in the covenant.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

#### **Verse 8 — “And Elohim said to Noaḥ and to his sons…”**

- A formal covenant declaration begins, with **all three sons present** — this is not just personal, but **dynastic**.
    

---

#### **Verse 9 — “Behold, I establish My covenant…”**

- **הִנְנִי מֵקִים (hin’ni meqim)** — “Behold, I am raising up / establishing”
    

> This is a **one-sided divine initiative**, not a mutual agreement.

- **בְּרִית (berit)** — covenant, alliance, binding promise
    

> First explicit use of this term in the Bible to denote a **universal, enduring agreement**.

- **“With your seed after you”** — future generations are **legally included** from the outset
    

---

#### **Verse 10 — “With every living creature…”**

- **נֶפֶשׁ חַיָּה (nefesh ḥayyah)** — “living soul” — used of both man and animal in Genesis 1–2
    

> This covenant is **multispecies**, not anthropocentric

- **Birds, cattle, wild beasts… all that go out of the ark**
    

> The emphasis is comprehensive: **all terrestrial, breath-bearing life** is under this covering

---

### Theological Significance:

- This is the **broadest covenant in Scripture** — it includes:
    
    - All of humanity
        
    - All land animals
        
    - All future generations
        
- It is the **foundation of natural law** and the basis for **ecological and civil stability** post-Flood
    

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Some limit covenants to Israel, but this one **predates Abraham**, Sinai, and Torah — it applies to **all creation**
    

> Genesis 9:8–10 is the **universal covenant of preservation**, not redemption — but it foreshadows the need for a **better covenant still to come**.

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

- **Late 2nd month, AM 1657**
    
- Spoken immediately after Noaḥ’s altar and YHWH’s vows (Genesis 8:20–22)

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
8. “And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying,”  
9. “And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after you,”  
10. “And with every living creature… that is with you, from all that go out of the ark…”

**YLT:**  
8. “And God speaketh unto Noah, and unto his sons with him, saying,”  
9. “And I — lo, I am establishing My covenant with you, and with your seed after you,”  
10. “And with every living creature that [is] with you…”

**NIV:**  
8. “Then God said to Noah and to his sons with him:”  
9. “‘I now establish my covenant with you and with your descendants after you,’”  
10. “‘and with every living creature that was with you…’”

> KJV and YLT preserve the **covenantal weight**. NIV is accurate but less formal in tone.

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

- **Genesis 6:18** — “I will establish My covenant with you…” — this is the **fulfillment** of that promise
    
- **Hosea 2:18** — YHWH makes a covenant “with the beasts of the field…” — echo of this foundational covenant
    
- **Romans 8:21** — “The creation itself will be set free…” — the **whole creation groans under sin**, but was once covenanted for preservation
    

> Genesis 9:8–10 marks the **first legal and relational bond** between YHWH and the **post-Flood world** — rooted not in merit, but in **mercy and divine initiative**.
