### **GENESIS 9:7**

_Scroll of Noaḥ_  
(Traditional Genesis 9:7)  
**Multiply and Abound Upon the Earth**

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And you, be fruitful and multiply; swarm in the earth and multiply in it.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וְאַתֶּם  
פְּרוּ וּרְבוּ  
שִׁרְצוּ בָאָרֶץ  
וּרְבוּ־בָהּ

---

#### Transliteration:

_Ve’atem  
peru u’revu,  
shir’tzu va’aretz,  
u’revu vah._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“But do ye then increase and multiply, and fill the earth, and have dominion over it.”

> LXX adds a familiar element: “fill the earth and have dominion,” reflecting Genesis 1:28, but the MT is more focused on **swarming abundance** and **multiplication**.

---

#### DSS (4QGen):

Agrees with MT. The two-fold command structure — **swarm** and **multiply** — is preserved with no textual variants.

---

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“And you…” (וְאַתֶּם)**

- Plural emphatic — addressed directly to **Noaḥ, Shem, Ḥam, and Yephet**
    

> This is a reaffirmation of humanity’s **mandate and destiny** in the post-Flood world.

---

**“Be fruitful and multiply” (פְּרוּ וּרְבוּ)**

- Repetition of Genesis 1:28 and 9:1 — this is the **third instance** of the **fruitfulness mandate**, emphasizing:
    
    - The urgency of **population growth**
        
    - The sanctity of **human life and propagation**
        

> After establishing the sanctity of blood (v. 4–6), YHWH now **reaffirms life as the central purpose** of human existence.

---

**“Swarm in the earth” (שִׁרְצוּ בָאָרֶץ)**

- **שָׁרַץ (sharatz)** — to swarm, teem, proliferate
    

> Describes creatures in Genesis 1:20–21 — now applied to mankind

> This is **abundant multiplication**, not mere survival — a return to **vibrant fertility**, not cautious repopulation.

---

**“Multiply in it” (וּרְבוּ־בָהּ)**

- Ends the thought with emphasis: mankind is not to remain clustered — but to **spread, fill, expand, and grow** across all the earth
    

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Some read this narrowly (i.e., just procreation), but the command to **swarm and multiply** is a cultural, civilizational imperative:
    
    - Build families
        
    - Expand territories
        
    - **Flourish in righteous dominion**
        

> This is the foundation of **civil society** in covenantal order — rooted in **fruitfulness, not conquest**.

---

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

- **27th day of 2nd month, AM 1657**
    
- Final line of YHWH’s speech before the formal covenant declaration (v. 8+)

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; bring forth abundantly in the earth, and multiply therein.”

**YLT:**  
“And ye, be fruitful and multiply, teem in the earth, and multiply in it.”

**NIV:**  
“As for you, be fruitful and increase in number; multiply on the earth and increase upon it.”

> KJV and YLT preserve the **vivid force of ‘teeming’**. NIV simplifies to readable modern English but misses the poetic redundancy.

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

- **Genesis 1:28** — “Be fruitful, multiply, fill the earth…” — mankind resumes its original role after the reset.
    
- **Genesis 11:4** — contrast: man later resists this command at Babel, refusing to spread — prompting divine intervention.
    
- **Isaiah 45:18** — “[He] formed it to be inhabited” — YHWH desires a **filled earth**, not a centralized or barren one.
    

> Genesis 9:7 concludes the foundational commandments of post-Flood humanity: **preserve life, protect life, and reproduce life** — all under divine mandate.
