#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**16.** And the bow shall be in the cloud, and I will see it, to remember the everlasting covenant between Elohim and every living soul of all flesh that is upon the earth.  
**17.** And Elohim said to Noaḥ: “This is the sign of the covenant that I have established between Me and all flesh that is upon the earth.”

#### Hebrew (MT):

**16**  
וְהָיְתָה הַקֶּשֶׁת בֶּעָנָן  
וּרְאִיתִיהָ לִזְכֹּר  
בְּרִית עוֹלָם  
בֵּין אֱלֹהִים וּבֵין כָּל־נֶפֶשׁ חַיָּה  
בְּכָל־בָּשָׂר אֲשֶׁר עַל־הָאָרֶץ

**17**  
וַיֹּאמֶר אֱלֹהִים אֶל־נֹחַ  
זֹאת אוֹת הַבְּרִית  
אֲשֶׁר הֲקִמֹתִי  
בֵּינִי וּבֵין כָּל־בָּשָׂר  
אֲשֶׁר עַל־הָאָרֶץ

#### Transliteration:

**16**  
_Ve’haytah haqeshet beʿanan,  
u’re’itihah lizkor  
berit ʿolam  
bein Elohim u’vein kol-nefesh ḥayyah  
bekhol basar asher ʿal ha’aretz._

**17**  
_Vayyomer Elohim el-Noaḥ:  
zot ot ha’berit  
asher haqimoti  
beini u’vein kol basar  
asher ʿal ha’aretz._

#### LXX (Brenton):

**16.** “And the bow shall be in the cloud, and I will look upon it to remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living soul in all flesh that is upon the earth.”  
**17.** “And the Lord God said to Noah, ‘This is the sign of the covenant which I have established between Me and all flesh that is upon the earth.’”

> LXX affirms the **everlasting scope**, and YHWH’s **active recognition** of the bow as a divine signal.

#### DSS (4QGen):

Matches MT with high fidelity. The phrasing **“everlasting covenant” (בְּרִית עוֹלָם)** is preserved.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

#### **Verse 16 — “The bow shall be in the cloud… I will see it… to remember the everlasting covenant”**

- Divine perception: **“I will see it” (וּרְאִיתִיהָ)** — YHWH is **not distant** from the visible world
    
- **“Everlasting covenant” (בְּרִית עוֹלָם)** — not temporal or conditional
    

> This covenant endures **as long as the earth remains** (cf. Genesis 8:22)

> YHWH takes visual note of His own oath — this is a **legal and relational promise** embedded in nature.

---

**Scope of the Covenant:**

- **Between Elohim and every living soul**
    
- **Of all flesh that is upon the earth**
    

> The emphasis is maximal: all species, all humanity, all generations

---

#### **Verse 17 — “This is the sign of the covenant…”**

- Repeats and seals the declaration — **covenantal repetition = legal formalization**
    
- **“Which I have established” (הֲקִמֹתִי)** — past perfect: the covenant is already ratified
    

> This verse closes the bow passage with **divine witness and verbal certification**

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Many see rainbows as sentimental or purely meteorological — but Scripture frames them as a **covenantal trigger for divine restraint**.
    

> Genesis 9 does not describe a pretty phenomenon — it reveals a **cosmic treaty witnessed by both heaven and earth**, with a **weapon of war laid down in the sky**.

---

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

- **Late 2nd month, AM 1657**
    
- Culmination of the covenant sequence (Genesis 9:8–17)

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
16. “And the bow shall be in the cloud… to remember the everlasting covenant…”  
17. “And God said unto Noah, This is the token of the covenant…”

**YLT:**  
16. “And the bow hath been in the cloud, and I have seen it to remember the covenant age-during…”  
17. “And God saith unto Noah, This [is] a token of the covenant…”

**NIV:**  
16. “Whenever the rainbow appears in the clouds, I will see it and remember the everlasting covenant…”  
17. “So God said to Noah, ‘This is the sign of the covenant…’”

> KJV and YLT preserve legal gravity and phrasing. NIV remains readable but softens covenantal formality.

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

- **Psalm 89:34** — “I will not violate My covenant, nor alter the word that has gone out of My lips.”
    
- **Hebrews 6:17–18** — God confirmed His promise with an oath, so that **by two immutable things… we might have strong consolation**
    
- **Revelation 10:1** — the angel clothed with a cloud and **a rainbow on his head** — visual continuity from Genesis to apocalypse
    

> Genesis 9:16–17 ends the Flood narrative not with a ritual, but with **a living sign** — a banner of mercy between YHWH and the living world.
