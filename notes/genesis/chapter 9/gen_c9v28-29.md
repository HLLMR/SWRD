aḥar ha’mabbul

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

#### **“Noaḥ lived after the flood 350 years…”**

- The **Flood ends at age 600** (cf. Gen 7:6; 8:13), and he lives another 350
    

> His life **spans two worlds**: the corrupted antediluvian and the rebooted postdiluvian

- His post-Flood years include:
    
    - Reestablishing agriculture (9:20)
        
    - Fatherly rulership over Shem, Ḥam, and Yephet
        
    - Prophetic declarations over nations (9:24–27)
        

> Yet, Scripture records **no new sons**, suggesting his household remains limited to the existing lines

---

#### **“All the days of Noaḥ were 950 years…”**

- Matches the age of **Methuselah’s father, Enoch’s son Lamech (cf. Gen 5:31)**
    
- Noaḥ becomes the **last patriarch to live over 900 years**, marking the transition to **shortening lifespans**
    

---

#### **“And he died…” (וַיָּמֹת)**

- Echo of the refrain from Genesis 5 — despite righteousness and covenant, **death still reigns**
    

> The covenant of Genesis 9 is a **preservation covenant**, not a resurrection one — **Noaḥ dies**, but leaves a legacy of righteousness, survival, and prophecy

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Some ignore Noaḥ’s full arc, treating him only as a boat-builder
    

> Yet Scripture presents him as **prophet, priest, patriarch, and founder of post-Flood civilization**

> His death closes a chapter — not just of a man, but of **a pre-Babel era** where **one family governed the earth under a known covenant**

---

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

- **Born in AM 1056** (cf. Genesis 5:29)
    
- **Died in AM 2006**, two years before Avram’s birth (AM 2008) — a generational **hinge point**

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
28. “And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years.”  
29. “And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years: and he died.”

**YLT:**  
28. “And Noah liveth after the deluge three hundred and fifty years;”  
29. “And all the days of Noah are nine hundred and fifty years, and he dieth.”

**NIV:**  
28. “After the flood Noah lived 350 years.”  
29. “Noah lived a total of 950 years, and then he died.”

> All agree — solemn, final, factual.

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

- **Genesis 5:5–32** — mirrors the genealogy and lifespan structure
    
- **Genesis 11:10** — the Toledoth of Shem picks up immediately after Noaḥ
    
- **Hebrews 11:7** — Noaḥ is remembered as an heir of righteousness, moving by **faith**, not just obedience
    

> Genesis 9:28–29 closes the **Scroll of Noaḥ** with quiet finality — a righteous man whose life preserved the world, but who still awaits the **true ark of resurrection**.
