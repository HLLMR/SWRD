### **GENESIS 9:26–27**

_Scroll of Noaḥ_  
(Traditional Genesis 9:26–27)  
**Blessings on Shem and Yephet**

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**26.** And he said: “Blessed be YHWH, Elohim of Shem; and let Kenaʿan be his servant.”  
**27.** “May Elohim enlarge Yephet, and let him dwell in the tents of Shem; and let Kenaʿan be his servant.”

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

**26**  
וַיֹּאמֶר  
בָּרוּךְ יְהוָה אֱלֹהֵי שֵׁם  
וִיהִי כְנַעַן עֶבֶד לָמוֹ

**27**  
יַפְתְּ אֱלֹהִים לְיֶפֶת  
וְיִשְׁכֹּן בְּאָהֳלֵי שֵׁם  
וִיהִי כְנַעַן עֶבֶד לָמוֹ

---

#### Transliteration:

**26**  
_Vayyomer:  
Barukh YHWH Elohei Shem,  
vihi Kenaʿan ʿeved lamo._

**27**  
_Yaft Elohim le’Yephet,  
veyishkon be’oholei Shem,  
vihi Kenaʿan ʿeved lamo._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

**26.** “Blessed be the Lord God of Shem, and Canaan shall be his servant.”  
**27.** “May God enlarge Japheth, and let him dwell in the houses of Shem, and let Canaan be his servant.”

> LXX mirrors MT closely, preserving both **blessing and subjugation** — with emphasis on **YHWH as Shem’s Elohim** and **Kenaʿan’s subservience**.

---

#### DSS (4QGen):

Aligns fully with MT, including the **poetic symmetry** of the blessings and the repeated phrase **וִיהִי כְנַעַן עֶבֶד לָמוֹ (“let Kenaʿan be a servant to them”)**.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

#### **Verse 26 — “Blessed be YHWH, the Elohim of Shem”**

- First occurrence of **YHWH’s personal Name** (יהוה) in Genesis since the Flood narrative began
    

> Shem is uniquely aligned with **covenantal relationship**

- Shem is **not directly blessed** — rather, YHWH is praised **as Shem’s God**
    

> Highlights Shem’s **spiritual inheritance**, not just material prosperity

---

**“Let Kenaʿan be his servant”**

- Repeats v. 25’s judgment — this time **in relation to Shem**
    
- Points prophetically to:
    
    - Israel (through Shem) **displacing the Kenaʿani**
        
    - YHWH’s presence dwelling among Shem’s descendants (cf. Genesis 12, Exodus)
        

> Shem is the **spiritual heir** of Noaḥ — the line through whom **revelation, covenant, and Messiah** will come

---

#### **Verse 27 — “May Elohim enlarge Yephet…”**

- **יַפְתְּ (yaft)** — wordplay on **Yephet (Japheth)**
    
    - Means “enlarge,” “expand,” or “make room”
        

> Yephet is promised **territorial and civilizational expansion**

---

**“And let him dwell in the tents of Shem”**

- Highly debated phrase — multiple layers:
    
    - **Spiritual partnership** — Gentiles (Yephet) sharing in Shem’s spiritual inheritance
        
    - **Geopolitical alliance** — future cohabitation or cultural overlap
        
    - Possibly **messianic foreshadowing** — nations coming to the light of Israel’s Elohim
        

> Shem holds the **tent of revelation**; Yephet may **dwell within** through peace, humility, or adoption

---

**“Let Kenaʿan be his servant” (again)**

- Triple repetition of Kenaʿan’s servitude — the judgment is **comprehensive and enduring**
    
- Servitude to **both Shem and Yephet** shows Kenaʿan’s legacy is one of **reversal and subjugation**, not dominion

### Summary of Prophetic Outcomes:

|**Son**|**Blessing / Judgment**|**Trajectory**|
|---|---|---|
|**Shem**|YHWH is his Elohim; spiritual inheritance|Line of covenant, Torah, Messiah|
|**Yephet**|Enlargement and tent-sharing with Shem|Gentile nations, philosophical & civil reach|
|**Kenaʿan**|Servitude to both brothers|Judgment fulfilled in conquest and dispersion|

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- These verses have been **weaponized historically** to justify slavery and racial hierarchy — yet:
    
    - **Ḥam is not cursed** — only Kenaʿan
        
    - The focus is **covenantal, not racial**
        
    - Kenaʿan’s destiny is tied to **spiritual opposition**, not genetics
        

> The text speaks prophetically of **future conflict and submission**, not innate superiority

---

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

- Still **AM 1662**, following Noaḥ’s recovery from wine and insight into his sons’ actions
    

---

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
26. “Blessed be the Lord God of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.”  
27. “God shall enlarge Japheth… and Canaan shall be his servant.”

**YLT:**  
26. “Blessed of Jehovah my God [is] Shem, And Canaan is servant to him.”  
27. “God doth give beauty to Japheth, And he dwelleth in tents of Shem…”

**NIV:**  
26. “Praise be to the Lord, the God of Shem! May Canaan be the slave of Shem.”  
27. “May God extend Japheth’s territory… and may Canaan be the slave of Japheth.”

> KJV and YLT maintain covenantal tone. NIV simplifies the language, but slightly flattens the **spiritual implications**.

---

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

- **Genesis 10:21–32** — development of the nations from these three sons
    
- **Genesis 12:1–3** — blessing of Avram (from Shem) and promise of blessing to all nations
    
- **Isaiah 2:2–4** — “All nations shall flow to the mountain of YHWH…” — Yephet dwelling in Shem’s tents
    

> Genesis 9:26–27 is the **blueprint of post-Flood humanity**: a divided world shaped by **honor, obedience, and prophetic calling**.
