### **GENESIS 9:19**

_Scroll of Noaḥ_  
(Traditional Genesis 9:19)  
**The Source of All Nations**

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**These three were the sons of Noaḥ, and from them was the whole earth overspread.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

שְׁלֹשָׁה אֵלֶּה בְּנֵי־נֹחַ  
וּמֵאֵלֶּה נָפְצָה כָל־הָאָרֶץ

---

#### Transliteration:

_Sheloshah eileh bnei-Noaḥ,  
u’me’eileh nafetzah kol ha’aretz._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“These three are the sons of Noe: of these were men scattered over all the earth.”

> The LXX affirms both the number and the **dispersal outcome** — universal population through the three sons.

---

#### DSS (4QGen):

Fully consistent with MT. The phrase **נָפְצָה כָל־הָאָרֶץ** ("was scattered") appears unchanged.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“These three were the sons of Noaḥ…”**

- Reaffirming the identity and centrality of **Shem**, **Ḥam**, and **Yephet**
    

> This verse **seals their legal role** as the progenitors of all post-Flood humanity

---

**“From them was the whole earth overspread” (נָפְצָה כָל־הָאָרֶץ)**

- **נָפַץ (nafatz)** — to disperse, scatter, spread abroad
    

> Strong verb indicating **intentional outward migration**, later echoed in **Genesis 11:8**

- This is not just genealogical — it is **geopolitical**:
    
    - All nations, tribes, languages, and territories come from this **three-branch rootstock**
        

> The verse subtly anticipates both the **Table of Nations (Genesis 10)** and the **Babel scattering (Genesis 11)**

---

### Historical and Theological Weight:

- This verse serves as a **genealogical hinge point**:
    
    - Ends the Flood narrative
        
    - Begins the **nations narrative**
        

> Every culture and people group finds **its roots here**, under the legacy of **Noaḥ and his sons** — and therefore under **the covenant of preservation** just declared.

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Some distort this verse to support racist ideologies or unscriptural lineages (e.g., claiming modern ethnic superiority via Shem or Yephet)
    

> Scripture clearly states that **all humanity** shares this **one origin** — and is equally bound to YHWH’s covenant

> This is not a hierarchy — it is a **unifying origin**, pointing to **shared accountability and shared blessing**.

---

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

- **Approximately 1657–1658 AM**, depending on how quickly Noaḥ’s family begins to spread and settle post-ark
    

---

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“These are the three sons of Noah: and of them was the whole earth overspread.”

**YLT:**  
“These three [are] sons of Noah, and from these hath all the earth been overspread.”

**NIV:**  
“These were the three sons of Noah, and from them came the people who were scattered over the whole earth.”

> All translations agree in form and function. YLT retains closest structural alignment.

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

- **Genesis 10:32** — “From these the nations were divided on the earth after the flood” — perfect bookend to this verse
    
- **Acts 17:26** — “From one blood He made every nation of men to dwell on all the face of the earth…”
    
- **Revelation 7:9** — “A great multitude… from every nation, tribe, people, and tongue…” — all returning to YHWH from this shared origin
    

> Genesis 9:19 is the **seed of human civilization** — a genealogical heartbeat echoing through time, uniting us under the same judgment, mercy, and calling.
