# Scroll of Noaḥ

## Chapter 9

### Covenant and Commission

#### GENESIS 9:1

**And Elohim blessed Noaḥ and his sons, and said to them: “Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth.”**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וַיְבָרֶךְ אֱלֹהִים אֶת־נֹחַ  
וְאֶת־בָּנָיו  
וַיֹּאמֶר לָהֶם  
פְּרוּ וּרְבוּ  
וּמִלְאוּ אֶת־הָאָרֶץ

---

#### Transliteration:

_Vayevarekh Elohim et-Noaḥ  
ve’et banav,  
vayyomer lahem:  
peru u’revu,  
u’mil’u et-ha’aretz._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said to them, ‘Increase and multiply, and fill the earth.’”

> LXX fully aligns, translating “blessed” as **εὐλόγησεν**, and maintaining the same commission as in Genesis 1.

#### DSS (4QGen):

Faithfully follows MT structure. Blessing and command language intact.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“And Elohim blessed Noaḥ and his sons…”**

- The **first explicit blessing since the Flood** — a divine affirmation of **continuity and favor**.
    
- This mirrors the **original blessing** of mankind in **Genesis 1:28** — signaling a **fresh creation mandate**.
    

---

**“Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth” (פְּרוּ וּרְבוּ וּמִלְאוּ)**

- **פְּרוּ (peru)** — bear fruit
    
- **וּרְבוּ (u’revu)** — become many, multiply
    
- **וּמִלְאוּ (u’mil’u)** — fill, replenish
    

> This triple-command forms the core of **human purpose** in the post-Flood age: not just survival, but **expansion** under divine blessing.

---

**Covenantal Continuity:**

- The same words given to **Adam and Ḥavvah (Genesis 1:28)** are now given to **Noaḥ and his sons** — affirming **Noaḥ as the new head of humanity**.
    

> The new world begins as the old one did — with a divine command to **become fruitful, fill the earth, and live under YHWH’s favor**.

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Modern interpreters often spiritualize this, but in context, this is a **literal and reproductive mandate** — necessary for the **restoration of mankind’s dominion** on a cleansed earth.
    

> The Flood removed corruption. This command reestablishes **life and order**.

---

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

- **Late 2nd month, AM 1657**, shortly after Noaḥ’s exit from the ark and altar offering

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.”

**YLT:**  
“And God blesseth Noah and his sons, and saith to them, ‘Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the earth;’”

**NIV:**  
“Then God blessed Noah and his sons, saying to them, ‘Be fruitful and increase in number and fill the earth.’”

> All convey the essence. KJV’s “replenish” reflects early English usage. YLT retains the strongest structural fidelity.

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

- **Genesis 1:28** — original creation blessing
    
- **Genesis 35:11** — blessing to Jacob: “be fruitful and multiply”
    
- **Acts 17:26** — “He made from one blood all nations… to dwell on all the face of the earth”
    

> Genesis 9:1 is not just the restart of civilization — it’s a **recommissioning of mankind under divine covenant**.
