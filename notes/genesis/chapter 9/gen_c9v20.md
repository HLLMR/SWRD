### **GENESIS 9:20**

_Scroll of Noaḥ_  
(Traditional Genesis 9:20)  
**Noaḥ the Husbandman**

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And Noaḥ began to be a man of the soil, and he planted a vineyard.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וַיָּחֶל נֹחַ  
אִישׁ הָאֲדָמָה  
וַיִּטַּע כָּרֶם

---

#### Transliteration:

_Vayyaḥel Noaḥ  
ish ha’adamah,  
vayyitta keren._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And Noe began to be a husbandman, and he planted a vineyard.”

> LXX matches the MT exactly, rendering “ish ha’adamah” as **γεωργὸς (geōrgos)** — farmer, tiller of the land.

---

#### DSS (4QGen):

Affirms the MT. The terms for “man of the ground” and “vineyard” are consistent and intact.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“Noaḥ began to be a man of the soil…” (אִישׁ הָאֲדָמָה)**

- **וַיָּחֶל (vayyaḥel)** — "he began," but the root also connotes:
    
    - _To profane_ (ḥalal), or
        
    - _To initiate_ something risky or negative
        

> Many commentators note this double meaning — suggesting this “beginning” is **morally or spiritually fraught**.

- **אִישׁ הָאֲדָמָה (ish ha’adamah)** — “man of the ground”
    

> Links directly to **Adam (אֲדָם)** and the cursed ground from Genesis 3:17–19 and Genesis 5:29

> Noaḥ’s return to the ground is both **a restoration of life** and a **recapitulation of Adam’s struggle**

---

**“He planted a vineyard” (וַיִּטַּע כָּרֶם)**

- First mention of viticulture in Scripture
    

> Planting a vineyard suggests a degree of **stability, long-term settlement, and agrarian civilization** returning

> However, the text places this moment **right before a moral failure**, suggesting potential danger in leisure and overindulgence

---

### Narrative Setup:

- This quiet verse opens the door to the **only recorded failure of Noaḥ’s life** — the incident that follows with **wine, nakedness, and Ḥam**
    

> What began with **fruitful labor** (planting) will soon expose **the vulnerability of fallen man**, even one as righteous as Noaḥ

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Some interpretations romanticize Noaḥ as a wise farmer or inventor of wine. The Hebrew narrative, however, **builds dramatic tension** with subtle cues:
    
    - “He began” — an ominous start
        
    - “Man of the ground” — echoes Adam’s post-fall toil
        
    - “Planted a vineyard” — immediately leads to intoxication and shame
        

> The text is **not condemning agriculture or wine**, but is warning of what **unrestrained enjoyment can lead to**, even among the righteous

---

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

- Estimated **AM 1657–1660**, depending on growth time of grapevines and fermentation
    

> Likely **a few years post-Flood**, after land was resettled and vines matured

---

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And Noah began to be a husbandman, and he planted a vineyard.”

**YLT:**  
“And Noah remaineth a man of the ground, and planteth a vineyard,”

**NIV:**  
“Noah, a man of the soil, proceeded to plant a vineyard.”

> KJV and LXX preserve the **moral ambiguity** of “began.” NIV simplifies to neutral narrative.

---

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

- **Genesis 2:15** — Adam placed in a garden to “dress and keep it” — echoes Noaḥ as gardener-farmer
    
- **Proverbs 20:1** — “Wine is a mocker, strong drink is raging…” — a warning foreshadowed by what comes next
    
- **John 15:1** — “I am the true vine, and My Father is the vinedresser…” — the vineyard becomes a symbol of both **blessing and accountability**
    

> Genesis 9:20 is the **turning point** — from global covenant to personal vulnerability, where the second Adam faces the **temptations of rest and abundance**.
