### **GENESIS 9:23**

_Scroll of Noaḥ_  
(Traditional Genesis 9:23)  
**Shem and Yephet Cover Their Father**

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And Shem and Yephet took the garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father. And their faces were turned away, and they did not see their father’s nakedness.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וַיִּקַּח שֵׁם וְיֶפֶת אֶת־הַשִּׂמְלָה  
וַיָּשִׂימוּ עַל־שְׁכֵם שְׁנֵיהֶם  
וַיֵּלְכוּ אָחוֹרַנִּית  
וַיְכַסּוּ אֵת עֶרְוַת אֲבִיהֶם  
וּפְנֵיהֶם אֲחֻרַנִּית  
וְעֶרְוַת אֲבִיהֶם לֹא רָאוּ

---

#### Transliteration:

_Vayyiqqaḥ Shem ve’Yephet et-ha’simlah,  
vayyasimu ʿal-shekhem sheneihem,  
vayyel’khu aḥoranit,  
vaykhasu et-ʿervat avihem,  
ufeneihem aḥuranit,  
ve-ʿervat avihem lo ra’u._

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And Sem and Japheth having taken a garment, laid it on both their backs, and went backwards, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their face was turned away, and they saw not the nakedness of their father.”

> LXX reinforces the care taken by Shem and Yephet — not only in action, but in **intentional reverence** and restraint.

---

#### DSS (4QGen):

Fully consistent with MT. The critical phrases — “went backward,” “did not see,” and “covered” — are all preserved.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

#### **“Shem and Yephet took the garment…”**

- **אֶת־הַשִּׂמְלָה (et-ha’simlah)** — a specific covering, robe, or outer garment
    

> Singular garment shared, symbolizing **unity in honor**, and **shared righteousness**

---

**“And laid it upon both their shoulders”**

- Symbolic act of **bearing the burden of another’s shame**, done **together** — no competition, no pride
    

> The act is deliberate, cooperative, and solemn — they take it **upon themselves** to restore dignity

---

**“Went backward… their faces turned away…”**

- A visual of **reverence, restraint, and submission** to divine and familial order
    
- **“They did not see”** (לֹא רָאוּ) — a direct counterpoint to Ḥam’s **voyeurism and dishonor**
    

> In the new world, righteousness is seen not just in sacrifice, but in **how shame is handled**

---

### Moral and Spiritual Significance:

- **Shem and Yephet** model what Scripture consistently values:
    
    - **Honor over exposure**
        
    - **Restoration over ridicule**
        
    - **Action over gossip**
        

> They embody **covenantal obedience in family context**, even when faced with a patriarch’s failure

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Some modern readings flatten this into mere decency — but in the biblical framework, this is **a redemptive act**, a **covering of shame**, evocative of Eden (Genesis 3:21)
    

> The righteous do not ignore sin — they respond with **humility, covering, and preservation**

---

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

- Still **AM 1660–1662**, moments after the events of v. 22
    

---

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And Shem and Japheth took a garment… and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father…”

**YLT:**  
“And Shem and Japheth take the garment… and their faces [are] backward…”

**NIV:**  
“But Shem and Japheth took a garment and laid it across their shoulders; then they walked in backward…”

> KJV and YLT retain **visual and moral gravity**. NIV simplifies but conveys the essential reverence.

---

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

- **Genesis 3:21** — “YHWH made garments… and clothed them” — divine model of **covering shame with grace**
    
- **1 Peter 4:8** — “Love covers a multitude of sins” — echoed in this fraternal act
    
- **Galatians 6:1** — “Restore… in a spirit of meekness…” — this is restoration in action
    

> Genesis 9:23 is a **quiet moment of covenantal integrity**, where the future of the world is shaped by **the character of two sons** willing to honor, not expose.
