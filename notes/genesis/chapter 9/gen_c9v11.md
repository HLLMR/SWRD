### **GENESIS 9:11**

_Scroll of Noaḥ_  
(Traditional Genesis 9:11)  
**The Core of the Covenant: Never Again a Flood**

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**“And I will establish My covenant with you, and never again shall all flesh be cut off by the waters of the flood; and never again shall there be a flood to destroy the earth.”**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וַהֲקִמֹתִי אֶת־בְּרִיתִי אִתְּכֶם  
וְלֹא־יִכָּרֵת כָּל־בָּשָׂר  
עוֹד מִמֵּי הַמַּבּוּל  
וְלֹא־יִהְיֶה עוֹד מַבּוּל  
לְשַׁחֵת הָאָרֶץ

---

#### Transliteration:

_Vahaqimoti et-beriti it’khem,  
ve’lo-yikkaret kol-basar  
ʿod mimei hammabbul,  
ve’lo yihyeh ʿod mabbul  
le’shaḥet ha’aretz._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And I will establish My covenant with you; and all flesh shall not die any more by the water of the flood, and there shall not be any more a flood to destroy all the earth.”

> The LXX supports the MT — emphasizing that **global judgment by water is forever concluded** under this covenant.

---

#### DSS (4QGen):

Confirms the MT structure. The double **“never again” (עוֹד לֹא)** emphasis is preserved.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“And I will establish My covenant with you…”**

- Repeats v. 9 to **underscore legal certainty**
    
- **הֲקִימוֹתִי (haqimoti)** — “I will raise up, confirm, cause to stand”
    

> YHWH is not offering a suggestion — He is **instituting a permanent divine decree**.

---

**“Never again shall all flesh be cut off by floodwaters”**

- **יִכָּרֵת (yikkaret)** — “be cut off,” a term used for **judgment or covenantal severing**
    

> The **total destruction of terrestrial life** via flood is now **forbidden by divine self-restraint**.

---

**“Never again shall there be a flood to destroy the earth”**

- Not just humanity, but **the earth itself** will no longer be subject to total aqueous destruction.
    

> This is not a statement about all forms of judgment — only **global destruction by water** is ruled out.

---

### Theological Implications:

- This verse marks a **shift from retributive destruction to sustained preservation**
    
- It’s a **unilateral covenant** — not dependent on obedience, but on **divine mercy and governance**
    

> The promise becomes the **foundation of natural stability**, echoing Genesis 8:22 (“seedtime and harvest shall not cease…”)

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Some interpret this symbolically or locally, but the language is **absolute and global**:
    
    - “All flesh”
        
    - “Flood”
        
    - “Destroy the earth”
        

> Genesis 9:11 is YHWH’s direct declaration that **total global reset via water will never happen again** — by His own oath.

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

- **Late 2nd month, AM 1657**
    
- Continuation of the same divine speech that began in 9:8
    

---

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood…”

**YLT:**  
“And I have established My covenant with you, and all flesh is not more cut off…”

**NIV:**  
“I establish my covenant with you: Never again will all life be destroyed by the waters of a flood…”

> KJV and YLT closely mirror the Hebrew. NIV is clear, but less solemn in tone.

---

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

- **Isaiah 54:9** — “As in the days of Noaḥ… I swore that the waters would not cover the earth again…”
    
- **2 Peter 3:6–7** — Flood by water was first judgment; fire is prophesied as final cleansing
    
- **Revelation 21:1** — “There was no more sea…” — a vision of **eternal cosmic order**, beyond the reach of destructive chaos
    

> Genesis 9:11 anchors **the preservation of life** in divine oath. The world stands not because man is good, but because **YHWH is faithful**.
