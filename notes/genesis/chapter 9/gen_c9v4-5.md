_Scroll of Noaḥ_  
(Traditional Genesis 9:4–5)  
**The Sanctity of Blood and the Reckoning for Life**

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**4.** But flesh with its lifeblood — its blood — you shall not eat.  
**5.** And surely your lifeblood I will require: from every beast I will require it; and from the hand of man — from the hand of each man’s brother — I will require the life of man.

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

**4**  
אַךְ־בָּשָׂר בְּנַפְשׁוֹ דָמוֹ  
לֹא תֹאכֵלוּ

**5**  
וְאַךְ אֶת־דִּםְכֶם לְנַפְשֹׁתֵיכֶם  
אֶדְרֹשׁ  
מִיַּד כָּל־חַיָּה אֶדְרְשֶׁנּוּ  
וּמִיַּד הָאָדָם  
מִיַּד אִישׁ אָחִיו  
אֶדְרֹשׁ אֶת־נֶפֶשׁ הָאָדָם

#### Transliteration:

**4**  
_Akh basar be’nafsho damo  
lo tokhelu._

**5**  
_Ve’akh et-dimkhem le’nafshoteikhem  
edrosh —  
miyad kol ḥayyah edreshennu,  
u’miyad ha’adam,  
miyad ish aḥiv  
edrosh et-nefesh ha’adam._

#### LXX (Brenton):

**4.** “But flesh with the blood of life ye shall not eat.”  
**5.** “For your blood of your lives I will require a reckoning: at the hand of all beasts will I require it, and at the hand of man, and at the hand of every brother of man, will I require the life of man.”

> The LXX affirms the **prohibition on blood** and the **universal accountability for life**.

---

#### DSS (4QGen):

Faithfully reflects MT. The **threefold “I will require”** in verse 5 is preserved, emphasizing **legal and moral seriousness**.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

#### **Verse 4 — “Flesh with its lifeblood… you shall not eat”**

- **נֶפֶשׁ (nefesh)** — soul, life, breath-being
    
- **דָם (dam)** — blood = the vessel of life
    

> Blood is not merely symbolic — it is **sacred**, tied to **the very essence of life**.

> The command is absolute: even though meat is permitted (v. 3), blood is **never** to be consumed.

---

**Implication:**

- YHWH introduces the **principle of sacrificial sanctity**:
    
    - **Blood belongs to YHWH**, not to man
        
    - It will later serve as the **vehicle of atonement** (Leviticus 17:11)
        

> This command becomes a **cornerstone of Torah, Apostolic, and even Noahide law**.

---

#### **Verse 5 — “Your blood… I will require” (אֶדְרֹשׁ)**

- Root: **דָּרַשׁ (darash)** — to seek, demand, require
    

> Used here in **judicial form**: YHWH demands **legal reckoning** for all bloodshed

---

**“From every beast… from man… from his brother…”**

- Threefold structure:
    
    1. **Beasts** that kill humans will be held accountable
        
    2. **Humans** who shed blood — even accidental or familial — will face divine justice
        
    3. Emphasizes that **no one is above the law**, not even brothers (e.g., Cain and Abel)
        

> Bloodshed violates divine order and requires divine response.

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Modern views often downplay blood's sanctity — but in the biblical worldview, blood = **life itself**, and to consume or shed it wrongly is to **usurp divine authority**.
    
- Many also fail to see the **proto-legal framework** here — YHWH is establishing the **moral code for all post-Flood humanity**, not just Israel.

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
4. “But flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall ye not eat.”  
5. “And surely your blood of your lives will I require… at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man.”

**YLT:**  
4. “Only flesh in its life — its blood — ye do not eat.”  
5. “And only your blood for your lives do I require…”

**NIV:**  
4. “But you must not eat meat that has its lifeblood still in it.”  
5. “And for your lifeblood I will surely demand an accounting…”

> KJV and YLT preserve the strong legal tone. NIV simplifies, but **“demand an accounting”** still conveys the essence.

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

- **Genesis 4:10** — “Your brother’s blood cries to Me from the ground” — YHWH has always **demanded reckoning for blood**.
    
- **Leviticus 17:11** — “The life of the flesh is in the blood… it is the blood that makes atonement” — foundational for the sacrificial system.
    
- **Acts 15:20** — The Apostolic Decree to Gentiles: abstain from **blood**, from things strangled, and from sexual immorality — all rooted in this verse.
    

> Genesis 9:4–5 draws a red line: **blood belongs to YHWH**, and He alone determines the **justice due for its misuse**.
