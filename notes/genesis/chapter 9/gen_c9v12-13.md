### **GENESIS 9:12–13**

_Scroll of Noaḥ_  
(Traditional Genesis 9:12–13)  
**The Sign of the Covenant: The Bow in the Clouds**

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**12.** And Elohim said: “This is the sign of the covenant which I make between Me and you, and every living soul that is with you, for perpetual generations:  
**13.** I have set My bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a sign of the covenant between Me and the earth.”

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

**12**  
וַיֹּאמֶר אֱלֹהִים  
זֹאת אוֹת הַבְּרִית  
אֲשֶׁר אֲנִי נֹתֵן  
בֵּינִי וּבֵינֵיכֶם  
וּבֵין כָּל נֶפֶשׁ חַיָּה אֲשֶׁר אִתְּכֶם  
לְדֹרֹת עוֹלָם

**13**  
אֶת־קַשְׁתִּי נָתַתִּי בֶּעָנָן  
וְהָיְתָה לְאוֹת בְּרִית  
בֵּינִי וּבֵין הָאָרֶץ

#### Transliteration:

**12**  
_Vayyomer Elohim,  
zot ot ha’berit  
asher ani noten  
beini u’veineikhem  
u’vein kol nefesh ḥayyah asher it’khem  
le’dorot ʿolam._

**13**  
_Et-qashti natatti beʿanan,  
ve’haytah le’ot berit  
beini u’vein ha’aretz._

#### LXX (Brenton):

**12.** “And the Lord God said to Noah, ‘This is the sign of the covenant, which I establish between Me and you and every living creature with you, for perpetual generations.  
**13.** I set My bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a sign of covenant between Me and the earth.’”

> LXX aligns with MT. The word **“bow” (Greek: τόξον)** refers clearly to **a war-bow turned to peace**, not merely a rainbow.

---

#### DSS (4QGen):

Faithfully preserves the Hebrew wording, including the phrase **“My bow” (קַשְׁתִּי)** — confirming its symbolic weight as YHWH’s chosen sign.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

#### **Verse 12 — “This is the sign of the covenant…” (אוֹת הַבְּרִית)**

- **אוֹת (ot)** — sign, token, symbol
    
- This is the **first “sign” language** in a biblical covenant — here, linked to **cosmic visibility** for all creatures
    

> Unlike circumcision (Genesis 17), this sign is **universal**, visible to all, and not limited to human response

---

**“…for perpetual generations” (לְדֹרֹת עוֹלָם)**

- This covenant has **no expiration** until the world itself ends
    
- The bow is not just a **reminder to man**, but a **divine visual oath**
    

---

#### **Verse 13 — “I have set My bow in the cloud…” (אֶת־קַשְׁתִּי נָתַתִּי בֶּעָנָן)**

- **קֶשֶׁת (qeshet)** — bow (as in archer’s bow), not a distinct word for “rainbow”
    

> This invokes the image of a **war-bow hung up** — a **disarmed weapon** aimed away from the earth

> The symbol is not decorative, but **militarily significant**: YHWH is laying down His wrath.

---

**“It shall be for a sign between Me and the earth…”**

- Not just man, but the **whole earth** is included in the covenant scope
    

> This is a **cosmic treaty** — between the Sovereign King and the domain He judged and now preserves.

---

### Symbolic Depth:

- The bow points **upward**, toward the heavens — not downward at man
    
- Appears **after storms** — in the **context of judgment just passed**
    

> It’s a **visual testimony** of divine mercy at the threshold of power — YHWH remembers, restrains, and renews.

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Many modern renditions reduce the bow to a “colorful rainbow” — ignoring the profound **military disarmament imagery**.
    
- Others over-allegorize it, missing that YHWH explicitly says this is **His own chosen sign** — not man’s interpretation.
    

> This is a **divine declaration**, not poetic symbolism.

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

- **Late 2nd month, AM 1657**
    
- Same covenantal speech that began in Genesis 9:8

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
12. “This is the token of the covenant… for perpetual generations.”  
13. “I do set my bow in the cloud…”

**YLT:**  
12. “This is a token of the covenant… to generations age-during.”  
13. “My bow I have given in the cloud…”

**NIV:**  
12. “This is the sign of the covenant… for all generations to come.”  
13. “I have set my rainbow in the clouds…”

> KJV and YLT retain the **hebraic gravity** of “token” and “bow.” NIV uses “rainbow,” which captures the physical object but weakens the symbolic force.

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

- **Revelation 4:3** — “Around the throne was a rainbow…” — reappearance of the **heavenly covenant sign** in the final judgment scene
    
- **Ezekiel 1:28** — “Like the appearance of the bow in the cloud… this was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of YHWH” — divine throne surrounded by covenant reminder
    

> Genesis 9:12–13 introduces a **perpetual sign** — not just for memory, but as a **cosmic reminder of restraint, grace, and promise**.
