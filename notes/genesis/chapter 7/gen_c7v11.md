### **GENESIS 7:11**

_Scroll of Noaḥ_  
(Traditional Genesis 7:11)

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**In the six hundredth year of Noaḥ’s life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month — on that day all the fountains of the great deep burst forth, and the windows of the heavens were opened.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

בִּשְׁנַת שֵׁשׁ־מֵאוֹת שָׁנָה  
לְחַיֵּי נֹחַ  
בַּחֹדֶשׁ הַשֵּׁנִי  
בְּשִׁבְעָה עָשָׂר יוֹם לַחֹדֶשׁ  
בַּיּוֹם הַזֶּה  
נִבְקְעוּ כָּל־מַעְיְנוֹת תְּהוֹם רַבָּה  
וַאֲרֻבֹּת הַשָּׁמַיִם נִפְתָּחוּ

---

#### Transliteration:

_Bishnat shesh-me’ot shanah  
leḥayyei Noaḥ,  
baḥodesh hasheni,  
be’shivʿah ʿasar yom laḥodesh —  
bayom hazeh  
nibqeʿu kol maʿyenot tehom rabbah  
va’arubbot hashamayim niftachu._

#### LXX (Brenton):

“In the six hundredth year of the life of Noe, in the second month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, on this day all the fountains of the abyss were broken up, and the flood-gates of heaven were opened.”

> Note: **LXX reads “twenty-seventh” day**, possibly a scribal variant or interpretive gloss. MT clearly says **“seventeenth”** (שִׁבְעָה עָשָׂר).

---

#### DSS (4QGen):

Affirms the MT — **“seventeenth day”** is original. No alternate numerals are preserved in extant fragments.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“In the six hundredth year of Noaḥ’s life…”**

- **Fixed historical timestamp**: AM 1656, as previously calculated (cf. Genesis 7:6).
    
- This level of specificity reinforces that this is a **real-time, datable event**, not mythic abstraction.
    

---

**“Second month, seventeenth day…”**

- **Ancient Hebrew calendar** — likely from **creation**, not Exodus. Later formalized at Sinai (Exodus 12:2).
    

> This date becomes the **anchor point of the Flood chronology** — every other timing in chapters 7–8 traces back to this moment.

---

**“On that day all the fountains of the great deep burst forth…”**

- **נִבְקְעוּ (nibqeʿu)** — literally “were split open, ruptured”
    
- **תְּהוֹם רַבָּה (tehom rabbah)** — “the great deep” — same word used in Genesis 1:2 for **the chaotic primordial waters**
    

> This is **uncreation** — the reversal of Day Two and Day Three, when the waters were divided and the land appeared.

- The deep isn’t just water underground — it refers to the **cosmic ocean** beneath the firmament (cf. Psalm 104:6, Proverbs 8:28).
    

---

**“And the windows of the heavens were opened”**

- **אֲרֻבֹּת (arubbot)** — lattice-windows, sluices — **controlled portals** in the firmament
    
- This refers to the **upper waters** above the firmament (Genesis 1:7). Their opening implies **total collapse of protective separation**.
    

> The earth is assaulted from **below and above**, fulfilling a divine deconstruction of the created world.

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Many modern interpreters treat this metaphorically or naturalistically — e.g., underground springs and heavy rain.
    

> But the Hebrew cosmology here is **intentional and poetic** — not primitive, but theologically profound. The Flood is a **cosmic reset**, not just a weather event.

---

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**AM 1656 — 17th day of the 2nd month**

- This is the **precise moment the Flood begins** — the fulfillment of the prophecy in Genesis 6:17 and the schedule of Genesis 7:4.

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“In the six hundredth year of Noah’s life, in the second month, the seventeenth day of the month… were all the fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened.”

**YLT:**  
“In the six hundredth year of Noah’s life… burst have all fountains of the great deep, and the windows of the heavens have been opened.”

**NIV:**  
“In the six hundredth year of Noah’s life… on that day all the springs of the great deep burst forth, and the floodgates of the heavens were opened.”

> KJV and YLT retain poetic force; NIV uses “springs” and “floodgates” — accurate, but less evocative than the Hebrew **“tehom”** and **“arubbot.”**

---

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

- **Genesis 1:2–7** — creation divided the waters; the Flood reunites them.
    
- **2 Peter 3:5–6** — the world was **formed out of water and through water… by which it was destroyed**.
    
- **Psalm 78:23–24** — “He opened the doors of the heavens” — echo of **divine provision or judgment** through controlled openings.
    

> Genesis 7:11 is **the hour judgment fell** — the controlled creation gives way to chaos once more, and **only those within the ark live to see the new world**.
