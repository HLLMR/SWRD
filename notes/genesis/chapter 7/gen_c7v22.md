### **GENESIS 7:22**

_Scroll of Noaḥ_  
(Traditional Genesis 7:22)

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**Everything in whose nostrils was the breath of the spirit of life — of all that was on dry ground — died.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

כֹּל אֲשֶׁר נִשְׁמַת רוּחַ חַיִּים  
בְּאַפָּיו  
מִכֹּל אֲשֶׁר בֶּחָרָבָה  
מֵתוּ

---

#### Transliteration:

_Kol asher nishmat ruach ḥayyim  
be’appav,  
mikkol asher be’ḥaravah —  
metu._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And all things which have the breath of life, and whatever was on the dry land, died.”

> The LXX affirms both categories: **breath-bearing creatures** and **dry-land inhabitants** — showing the **specific target** of the judgment.

---

#### DSS (4QGen):

Agrees with MT — this is a confirmatory death declaration following verse 21, expanding the criteria for who perished.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“Everything in whose nostrils was the breath of the spirit of life…”**

- **נִשְׁמַת רוּחַ חַיִּים (nishmat ruach ḥayyim)** — “the breath of the spirit of life” — direct echo of:
    
    - **Genesis 2:7** — when Adam received this breath
        
    - **Genesis 6:17** — when YHWH announced its removal
        
- **בְּאַפָּיו (be’appav)** — “in his nostrils” — intimate, personal, physical language
    

> This specifies **nephesh life**: living, breathing, soul-bearing beings — not plants, not bacteria, not sea creatures.

---

**“Of all that was on dry ground…”**

- **בֶּחָרָבָה (be’ḥaravah)** — “on the dry land”
    

> Further narrows the scope: the flood didn’t touch **aquatic life**, but **everything breathing on land** was extinguished.

---

**“Died” (מֵתוּ, metu)**

- Simple, past-tense verb: **they died** — absolute and unambiguous
    

> This is the **final blow** of YHWH’s judgment on the pre-Flood world.

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- This verse closes every loophole: not symbolic, not partial, not regional.
    

> It confirms the **targets of judgment** were **living, breathing, terrestrial creatures**, including all mankind (v. 21).

---

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**~Day 40 of the Flood**

- Rain has ceased. The earth is now fully submerged, and all nephesh-bearing life on land is dead.

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“All in whose nostrils was the breath of life, of all that was in the dry land, died.”

**YLT:**  
“all in whose nostrils [is] breath of a living spirit — of all that [is] in the dry land — have died.”

**NIV:**  
“Everything on dry land that had the breath of life in its nostrils died.”

> All agree in substance. KJV preserves the **archaic reverence** of the phrase. NIV simplifies but maintains clarity.

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

- **Job 34:14–15** — “If He should take back His spirit and breath, all flesh would perish together…”
    
- **Ecclesiastes 3:19–20** — “They all have one breath…” — confirming this **shared vulnerability** of life.
    
- **Acts 17:25** — “He gives to all life and breath…” — only the Giver of breath can justly remove it.
    

> Genesis 7:22 is the **final exhalation of the old world** — a grave moment of cosmic silence as the breath of life departs from everything outside the ark.
