### **GENESIS 7:10**

_Scroll of Noaḥ_  
(Traditional Genesis 7:10)

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And it came to pass, after the seven days, that the waters of the flood were upon the earth.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וַיְהִי  
לְשִׁבְעַת הַיָּמִים  
וּמֵי הַמַּבּוּל  
הָיוּ עַל־הָאָרֶץ

---

#### Transliteration:

_Vayehi  
le’shivʿat ha’yamim,  
u’mei hammabbul  
hayu ʿal ha’aretz._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And it came to pass after the seven days, that the water of the flood came upon the earth.”

> The LXX confirms the exact match in chronology — the **seven-day warning** of Genesis 7:4 has now **expired**.

---

#### DSS (4QGen):

No variance from MT. The phrase “after seven days” is preserved verbatim, emphasizing **fulfilled prophetic timing**.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“And it came to pass…” (וַיְהִי)**

- This is the **standard narrative marker** for a new event — here, it signifies the **turning point from warning to judgment**.
    

---

**“After the seven days…”**

- **לְשִׁבְעַת הַיָּמִים (le’shivʿat ha’yamim)** — literally, “at the end of the seven days.”
    

> This links directly to Genesis 7:4 — YHWH’s final grace period has elapsed, and now **judgment begins** right on schedule.

---

**“The waters of the flood were upon the earth”**

- **וּמֵי הַמַּבּוּל (u’mei hammabbul)** — “waters of the flood” — the very phrase YHWH used in Genesis 6:17 and 7:6–7.
    
- The structure implies **sudden arrival** — not gradual climate shift, but a divine act of cosmic disruption.
    

> What was forewarned is now fulfilled. The era of patience has closed. The **age of uncreation has begun**.

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Some modern readings allegorize or soften the timeline — but the text is **clear, structured, and sequential**.
    

> This is not poetic license. This is **the countdown realized**, the calendar of divine justice **executed with precision**.

---

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**17th day of the 2nd month, AM 1656**

- This verse marks the **initiation of the deluge** — with time-specific detail given in the next verse (Genesis 7:11).

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And it came to pass after seven days, that the waters of the flood were upon the earth.”

**YLT:**  
“And it cometh to pass, after the seventh of the days, that waters of the deluge have been on the earth.”

**NIV:**  
“And after the seven days the floodwaters came on the earth.”

> All translations agree. The Hebrew brevity lends weight to the moment — **a stark turning point**.

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

- **Genesis 7:4** — the seven-day warning
    
- **Exodus 7:25** — seven days pass after the first plague on Egypt — echo of this countdown
    
- **Luke 17:27** — “Until the day Noaḥ entered the ark, and the flood came…” — Yeshua confirms **the suddenness of judgment**
    

> Genesis 7:10 closes the door on grace, and opens the floodgates of justice. The **first drop has fallen**.
