### **GENESIS 7:12**

_Scroll of Noaḥ_  
(Traditional Genesis 7:12)

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וַיְהִי הַגֶּשֶׁם  
עַל־הָאָרֶץ  
אַרְבָּעִים יוֹם וְאַרְבָּעִים לָיְלָה

---

#### Transliteration:

_Vayehi haggeshem  
ʿal ha’aretz  
arbaʿim yom ve’arbaʿim laylah._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights.”

> The LXX matches the MT exactly — emphasizing the **duration** and **completeness** of the judgment cycle.

---

#### DSS (4QGen):

Fully supports the MT — the text is short but critical. The **duration of the deluge** is preserved without variant.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“And the rain was upon the earth…”**

- **הַגֶּשֶׁם (haggeshem)** — “the rain” — used here **not as normal weather**, but as a **deluge of judgment**.
    
- This is not just moisture — it is **divinely ordained water of wrath**, in tandem with the fountains below (v. 11).
    

---

**“Forty days and forty nights”**

- This duration is both **literal** and **symbolic**:
    
    - **Literal**: a sustained 40-day downpour, enough to flood all terrestrial elevations (see v. 20)
        
    - **Symbolic**: “forty” signifies **testing, purification, and transition**
        
        - Israel’s 40 years in the wilderness (Numbers 14:33)
            
        - Moses’ 40 days on Sinai (Exodus 24:18)
            
        - Yeshua’s 40 days in the wilderness (Luke 4:2)
            

> Here, the **earth itself** undergoes a **forty-day baptism of death** — followed by rebirth through the remnant preserved in the ark.

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Some view “forty” as purely symbolic and disregard the literal rain duration — yet **Genesis 7:17** confirms it began and lasted **exactly forty days**.
    

> The precision is theological and calendrical — **YHWH keeps time**, even in judgment.

---

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**AM 1656 — 17th day of the 2nd month to 27th day of the 3rd month**

- This verse covers the **initial phase** of the Flood — active rainfall over a **full lunar cycle plus 10 days**.

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights.”

**YLT:**  
“And the shower is on the earth forty days and forty nights.”

**NIV:**  
“And rain fell on the earth forty days and forty nights.”

> All are in agreement. YLT’s “shower” understates the violence of the word **g̱eshem** in this context. KJV and NIV better preserve its weight.

---

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

- **Genesis 8:6** — the window is opened 40 days later — symbolically and literally closing the deluge phase.
    
- **Matthew 24:38–39** — “They knew not until the flood came…” — speaks to the **sudden, totalizing nature of the rain**.
    
- **1 Peter 3:20–21** — this **water of death** becomes a **type of baptism**, not merely for cleansing but for **separation and salvation**.
    

> Genesis 7:12 is not background detail — it is the **crescendo of divine justice**, poured down in **ordered fury** for forty unrelenting days.
