_Scroll of Noaḥ_  
(Traditional Genesis 7:18–19)

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**18.** And the waters prevailed and increased greatly upon the earth, and the ark moved upon the face of the waters.  
**19.** And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth, and all the high mountains that were under all the heavens were covered.

#### Hebrew (MT):

**18**  
וַיִּגְבְּרוּ הַמַּיִם  
וַיִּרְבּוּ מְאֹד עַל הָאָרֶץ  
וַתֵּלֶךְ הַתֵּבָה  
עַל־פְּנֵי הַמָּיִם

**19**  
וְהַמַּיִם גָּבְרוּ מְאֹד מְאֹד עַל הָאָרֶץ  
וַיְכֻסּוּ כָּל־הֶהָרִים הַגְּבֹהִים  
אֲשֶׁר־תַּחַת כָּל־הַשָּׁמָיִם

#### Transliteration:

**18**  
_Vayyigberu hamayim,  
vayyirbu me’od ʿal ha’aretz,  
va’telekh hatevah  
ʿal penei hammayim._

**19**  
_Ve’hamayim gavru me’od me’od ʿal ha’aretz,  
vayekussu kol he’harim hag’vohim  
asher tachat kol hashamayim._

#### LXX (Brenton):

**18.** “And the waters prevailed and abounded exceedingly upon the earth, and the ark was borne upon the water.”  
**19.** “And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth, and all the high mountains under heaven were covered.”

> LXX faithfully reflects the intensifiers in the Hebrew: **“me’od me’od” = exceedingly exceedingly** — emphasizing the **totality** of the Flood.

---

#### DSS (4QGen):

No variation from MT. The poetic escalation of the water’s strength and the covering of the mountains is confirmed.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**Verse 18 — “The waters prevailed and increased greatly…”**

- **וַיִּגְבְּרוּ (vayyigberu)** — prevailed, gained mastery — implies **overpowering control**, not passive rising.
    
- **וַיִּרְבּוּ מְאֹד (vayyirbu me’od)** — multiplied greatly — the language escalates from v. 17 to highlight unstoppable growth.
    
- **“The ark moved upon the face of the waters”**
    
    - **וַתֵּלֶךְ (va’telekh)** — to walk, go, float — a poetic verb showing the ark **in motion**, no longer grounded.
        

> The ark is now **adrift on the waters of judgment**, suspended between the old world and what comes next.

---

**Verse 19 — “The waters prevailed exceedingly exceedingly…”**

- **מְאֹד מְאֹד (me’od me’od)** — superlative expression. No mere flood — this is **cataclysmic coverage**.
    
- **“And all the high mountains… were covered”**
    
    - **כָּל־הֶהָרִים הַגְּבֹהִים (kol he’harim hag’vohim)** — “all the high mountains”
        
    - **אֲשֶׁר־תַּחַת כָּל־הַשָּׁמָיִם (asher tachat kol hashamayim)** — “that are under all the heavens”
        

> This phrasing demands **global coverage**. No regional interpretation suffices — the writer intends for us to understand **total terrestrial submersion**.

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Some argue this refers to a **local Mesopotamian flood**, but the text insists:
    
    - **All the mountains**
        
    - **Under all the heavens**
        
    - **Covered by water**
        

> The repetition and intensification are **literary and theological devices** affirming **total judgment**.

---

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Somewhere within days 20–30 of the 40-day rainfall window** (still within AM 1656)

- The water is now at **maximum expansion**, with the ark fully afloat and the earth fully submerged.

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
18. “And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters.”  
19. “And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high hills, that were under the whole heaven, were covered.”

**YLT:**  
18. “And the waters are mighty, and multiply exceedingly upon the earth; and the ark goeth on the face of the waters.”  
19. “And the waters have been very very mighty on the earth, and covered all the high mountains which are under the whole heavens.”

**NIV:**  
18. “The waters rose and increased greatly on the earth, and the ark floated on the surface of the water.”  
19. “They rose greatly on the earth, and all the high mountains under the entire heavens were covered.”

> KJV and YLT preserve the **poetic escalation**. NIV simplifies, but loses the **doubling of “me’od”** that underscores the **global intensity**.

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

- **Genesis 1:9–10** — where land emerged from water. Now, **the reversal**: all land is submerged.
    
- **Exodus 14:28** — “the waters returned and covered the chariots” — water as the **agent of divine justice**.
    
- **Psalm 104:6–9** — “You covered it with the deep as with a garment…” — poetic memory of this flood.
    

> These verses describe the **climax of uncreation**: a world fully drowned, with only the ark riding atop the wrath of the waters.
