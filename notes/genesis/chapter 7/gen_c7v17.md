### **GENESIS 7:17**

_Scroll of Noaḥ_  
(Traditional Genesis 7:17)

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And the flood was forty days upon the earth, and the waters increased and lifted up the ark, and it was raised above the earth.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וַיְהִי הַמַּבּוּל  
אַרְבָּעִים יוֹם עַל־הָאָרֶץ  
וַיִּרְבּוּ הַמַּיִם  
וַיִּשְׂאוּ אֶת־הַתֵּבָה  
וַתָּרָם מֵעַל הָאָרֶץ

---

#### Transliteration:

_Vayehi hammabbul  
arbaʿim yom ʿal ha’aretz,  
vayyirbu hamayim,  
vayyis’u et-hatevah,  
vattaram meʿal ha’aretz._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And the flood was upon the earth forty days and forty nights, and the water abounded greatly and lifted up the ark, and it was raised from off the earth.”

> LXX adds poetic force with “abounded greatly,” intensifying the Hebrew **וַיִּרְבּוּ (vayyirbu)** — “the waters multiplied.”

---

#### DSS (4QGen):

Matches MT without deviation. This verse begins the active **progression of destruction** and **salvation in motion**.

---

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“The flood was forty days upon the earth…”**

- Repeats **Genesis 7:12** with narrative tone shift — not a forecast, but now the **historical fulfillment**.
    
- **וַיְהִי (vayehi)** — classic marker of movement in biblical narrative. The event now unfolds in time.
    

---

**“And the waters increased…” (וַיִּרְבּוּ הַמַּיִם)**

- **רָבָה (rabbah)** — to multiply, increase abundantly.
    

> Echoes the pre-Flood world’s population expansion (Genesis 6:1), but now **in judgment**, not life.

---

**“And lifted up the ark…”**

- **וַיִּשְׂאוּ (vayyis’u)** — to bear, carry, elevate.
    
- This is a theological moment: the **vessel of salvation is raised above the chaos**, just as:
    
    - **Moses is lifted from the Nile** (Exodus 2:5)
        
    - **Yeshua is lifted up** on the cross and ascended (John 3:14, Acts 1:9)
        

> The ark rises as the world drowns — the **faithful are carried by what destroys the rest**.

---

**“And it was raised above the earth…”**

- **וַתָּרָם (vattaram)** — passive verb: “it was lifted up.”
    

> YHWH lifts Noaḥ’s house. The earth remains below — buried under the rising judgment.

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Some treat this as mythic or symbolic, but the structure and time markers affirm **literal sequence** and **real geography**.
    

> This verse is about **elevation** — both physical and moral. **Righteousness is lifted above ruin.**

---

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**17th day of 2nd month → ongoing through 26th day of 3rd month (AM 1656)**

- We are now inside the **forty-day rain window**, the most violent phase of the deluge.

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth.”

**YLT:**  
“And the deluge is forty days on the earth, and the waters multiply, and lift up the ark, and it is raised up from off the earth.”

**NIV:**  
“For forty days the flood kept coming on the earth, and as the waters increased they lifted the ark high above the earth.”

> KJV/YLT capture the poetic rising. NIV smooths the sequence but retains core meaning.

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

- **Psalm 29:10** — “YHWH sat enthroned at the Flood…” — this isn’t nature unleashed, it’s **judgment governed**.
    
- **1 Peter 3:20–21** — “few, that is eight souls, were saved by water…” — the waters that destroy also **lift the ark**.
    
- **Revelation 12:15–16** — a flood comes after the woman, but the earth helps her — flood as judgment and separation.
    

> Genesis 7:17 is the moment when **the storm lifts the righteous**. What is judgment for the world is **elevation for the faithful**.
