### **GENESIS 7:23**

_Scroll of Noaḥ_  
(Traditional Genesis 7:23)

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And He blotted out every living thing that was upon the face of the ground — from man to beast, to creeping thing, and to the flying creature of the heavens — and they were blotted out from the earth. And only Noaḥ remained, and those who were with him in the ark.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וַיִּמַּח אֶת־כָּל־הַיְקוּם  
אֲשֶׁר עַל־פְּנֵי הָאֲדָמָה  
מֵאָדָם עַד־בְּהֵמָה  
עַד־רֶמֶשׂ וְעַד־עוֹף הַשָּׁמָיִם  
וַיִּמָּחוּ מִן־הָאָרֶץ  
וַיִּשָּׁאֵר אַךְ נֹחַ  
וַאֲשֶׁר אִתּוֹ בַּתֵּבָה

---

#### Transliteration:

_Vayyimmaḥ et kol ha’yequm  
asher ʿal penei ha’adamah —  
me’adam ʿad behemah,  
ʿad remes veʿad ʿof hashamayim;  
vayyimmachu min ha’aretz.  
Vayyisha’er akh Noaḥ  
va’asher ito ba’tevah._

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And He blotted out every living thing which was upon the face of the earth, from man to cattle, and from reptiles even to birds of the sky; and they were blotted out from the earth. And Noe was left alone, and those with him in the ark.”

> LXX preserves full scope and solemnity. The phrase **“was left alone”** emphasizes the **remnant nature** of salvation.

---

#### DSS (4QGen):

Matches MT. The poetic structure and sequence of destruction-to-preservation is retained intact.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“And He blotted out every living thing…” (וַיִּמַּח אֶת־כָּל־הַיְקוּם)**

- **מָחָה (machah)** — to blot out, erase, obliterate — used elsewhere for:
    
    - Erasing names (Exodus 32:33)
        
    - Removing guilt or memory (Psalm 51:1)
        
    - Divine judgment (Deuteronomy 29:20)
        

> Not just death — this is **erasure from the record** of creation.

---

**“From man to beast… creeping thing… flying creature…”**

- This reversal of **Genesis 1’s creation order** affirms the **complete undoing** of terrestrial life.
    

> Judgment mirrors creation — in **perfect, deliberate, symmetrical order**.

---

**“And they were blotted out from the earth”**

- Repetition for emphasis — not just destroyed physically, but **removed from the land**, from covenantal ground.
    

> **The canvas of life has been wiped clean.**

---

**“Only Noaḥ remained…” (וַיִּשָּׁאֵר אַךְ נֹחַ)**

- **אַךְ (akh)** — “only,” “but,” or “surely” — emphasizes that **Noaḥ was the exception**.
    

> Amid total loss, **one family survives** — not by merit alone, but by covenant obedience and divine grace.

---

**“And those with him in the ark”**

- Corporate salvation — not just an individual, but a **remnant community**.
    
- Reflects the later principle: **“You and your household shall be saved”** (Acts 16:31).
    

> The ark is now a **floating remnant of the original world** — a seed capsule of future humanity.

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Some try to split this verse to reduce the scope of death — but the **doubling of “blotted out”** and full enumeration of creaturely categories makes this **unmistakable**.
    

> This is **not partial**, **not symbolic**, and **not mythic** — it is **total divine judgment** on all outside the covenant.

---

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**End of the 40-day rain period, ~Day 40 of Flood Year (AM 1656)**

- The record of death is complete. Preservation is now **limited to the ark**.

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground… and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark.”

**YLT:**  
“And wiped away is all the substance that [is] on the face of the ground… and remain doth only Noah, and those who [are] with him in the ark.”

**NIV:**  
“Every living thing on the face of the earth was wiped out… Only Noah was left, and those with him in the ark.”

> All translations faithfully carry the gravity. KJV and YLT best preserve the **covenantal overtones** of “remained” and “wiped out.”

---

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

- **Exodus 12:23** — The destroyer passes over the houses covered by blood, leaving a remnant.
    
- **Isaiah 1:9** — “If YHWH had not left us a very small remnant…”
    
- **Romans 11:5** — “Even so then at this present time there is a remnant according to the election of grace.”
    

> Genesis 7:23 is the **pivot point of human history**: the old world has ended, and only **Noaḥ and his arkborne community remain**.
