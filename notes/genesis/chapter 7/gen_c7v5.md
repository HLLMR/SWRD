### **GENESIS 7:5**

_Scroll of Noaḥ_  
(Traditional Genesis 7:5)

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And Noaḥ did according to all that YHWH commanded him.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וַיַּעַשׂ נֹחַ  
כְּכֹל אֲשֶׁר צִוָּה יְהוָה אֹתוֹ

---

#### Transliteration:

_Vayyaʿas Noaḥ  
ke’khol asher tzivvah YHWH oto._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And Noe did all things whatever the Lord God commanded him.”

> The LXX affirms total obedience, with the emphatic phrase **“πάντα ὅσα” (panta hosa)** — “all things whatsoever.”

---

#### DSS (4QGen):

No deviation from MT. This short but powerful line stands as a closing seal on **Noaḥ’s obedience cycle**.

---

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“And Noaḥ did…” (וַיַּעַשׂ)**

- This verb picks up from Genesis 6:22 — a repeated affirmation that Noaḥ is not just righteous in heart, but **righteous in action**.
    

> YHWH speaks → Noaḥ obeys. No questions. No excuses. No delays.

---

**“According to all that YHWH commanded him”**

- **כְּכֹל (ke’khol)** — “according to all” — totality, not partial compliance.
    
- This continues the Torah’s literary pattern of obedience following divine instruction:
    
    - Moses with the tabernacle (Exodus 40:16)
        
    - Joshua with Jericho (Joshua 6:25)
        
    - Yeshua with the Father (John 8:29)
        

> Obedience is a **hallmark of covenantal faith** — not legalism, but loving response to divine instruction.

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Noaḥ is often reduced to a “good guy who built a boat,” but the text presents him as **a man of covenantal obedience, prophetic action, and faithful stewardship.**
    

> He is a **new Adam**, tasked with preserving life, walking in faith, and passing judgment through righteousness.

---

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**AM 1656, 7 days before the Flood**

- This is **Noaḥ’s final act of preparation**. The ark is complete. The food is gathered. The animals are coming. The man is ready.

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And Noah did according unto all that the LORD commanded him.”

**YLT:**  
“And Noah doth according to all that Jehovah hath commanded him.”

**NIV:**  
“And Noah did all that the LORD commanded him.”

> All three renderings agree. The simplicity is powerful: **obedience without embellishment**.

---

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

- **Hebrews 11:7** — “By faith, Noaḥ… prepared an ark… and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith.”
    
- **John 14:15** — “If you love Me, keep My commandments.” — the same spirit of **relational obedience** that Noaḥ models here.
    
- **James 2:22** — “Faith was working with his works…” — Noaḥ’s faith and actions are perfectly united.
    

> This single verse seals **the righteous man’s readiness** — now only the rain remains.
