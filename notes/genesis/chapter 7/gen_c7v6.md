### **GENESIS 7:6**

_Scroll of Noaḥ_  
(Traditional Genesis 7:6)

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And Noaḥ was six hundred years old when the floodwaters came upon the earth.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וְנֹחַ בֶּן־שֵׁשׁ מֵאוֹת שָׁנָה  
וַיְהִי הַמַּבּוּל מַיִם  
עַל־הָאָרֶץ

---

#### Transliteration:

_Ve’Noaḥ ben-shesh me’ot shanah,  
vayehi hammabbul mayim  
ʿal ha’aretz._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And Noe was six hundred years old when the flood of water was upon the earth.”

> LXX matches MT exactly. “Flood of water” (κατακλυσμὸς ὕδατος) preserves the tone of **violent immersion and judgment**.

---

#### DSS (4QGen):

No deviation noted. The age and event timing are clearly marked — this is a pivotal chronological anchor.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“And Noaḥ was six hundred years old…”**

- **בֶּן־שֵׁשׁ מֵאוֹת שָׁנָה (ben-shesh me’ot shanah)** — literally “a son of six hundred years.”
    
- This gives us a **fixed point** in antediluvian chronology:
    

> Noaḥ born in **AM 1056** → Flood begins in **AM 1656**.

- This timing:
    
    - Occurs 100 years after **Genesis 5:32** (Noaḥ begot sons)
        
    - Completes the **120-year countdown** of Genesis 6:3
        
    - May correspond with the **death of Methuselah** (see traditions about the meaning of his name: “his death shall bring [it]”)
        

---

**“When the floodwaters came upon the earth”**

- The phrase **“הַמַּבּוּל מַיִם” (hammabbul mayim)** emphasizes that this is **not just rain** — it is **cataclysm**.
    

> “Mabbul” is only used of **Noaḥ’s Flood** in the Torah — a term reserved for this unique global judgment.

- The judgment that was **promised (Genesis 6:17)** and **scheduled (Genesis 7:4)** is now **formally dated and triggered**.
    

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Some interpret these ages symbolically or reject the timeline altogether — but Genesis builds a **careful genealogical and chronological framework**.
    

> The AM 1656 dating is **foundational** to biblical chronology, impacting:

- Patriarchal timelines
    
- Post-Flood genealogies
    
- Messianic prophecy cycles
    
- This is not just incidental. It is **the calibrated clock of divine history**.
    

---

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Precisely AM 1656**

- The flood begins **on the 17th day of the 2nd month** (Genesis 7:11), meaning this verse likely sets the **final timestamp** before the rains burst forth.

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was upon the earth.”

**YLT:**  
“And Noah [is] a son of six hundred years, and the flood of waters hath been on the earth.”

**NIV:**  
“Noah was six hundred years old when the floodwaters came on the earth.”

> All three agree. KJV and YLT retain Hebrew phrasing more directly. NIV simplifies slightly but keeps the essential detail.

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

- **Genesis 5:32** → Noaḥ at 500 years old (sons begin being born)
    
- **Genesis 7:11** → exact day of the flood eruption: 17th day, 2nd month, AM 1656
    
- **2 Peter 2:5** — “God did not spare the ancient world, but preserved Noaḥ…” — anchoring the flood as a **judicial moment in sacred history**
    

> Genesis 7:6 is the **divine timestamp**: the flood is no longer pending. **The days of man have reached their end.**
