### **GENESIS 7:7**

_Scroll of Noaḥ_  
(Traditional Genesis 7:7)

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And Noaḥ went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons’ wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וַיָּבֹא נֹחַ  
וּבָנָיו וְאִשְׁתּוֹ  
וּנְשֵׁי בָנָיו אִתּוֹ  
אֶל־הַתֵּבָה  
מִפְּנֵי מֵי הַמַּבּוּל

---

#### Transliteration:

_Vayyavo Noaḥ  
u’vanav ve’ishto  
u’neshei vanav ito  
el-hatevah  
mipnei mei hammabbul._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And Noe and his sons and his wife and his sons’ wives went into the ark because of the water of the flood.”

> LXX preserves the family structure and sequence — all enter **in response to the coming judgment**, not before.

---

#### DSS (4QGen):

Fully matches MT. The phrase **“because of the waters of the flood”** confirms the **timing and motivation** of their entry.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“And Noaḥ went in…”**

- The verb **וַיָּבֹא (vayyavo)** implies **deliberate, obedient entry** — this is the **execution** of YHWH’s command in 7:1.
    
- Repetition of Noaḥ’s obedience reinforces his role as the **archetype of covenant faithfulness**.

**“His sons, and his wife, and his sons’ wives with him…”**

- Household order echoes Genesis 6:18 and 7:1 — consistent **covenantal covering**:
    
    1. Noaḥ (covenant head)
        
    2. Sons (inheritance line)
        
    3. Wife (support and motherhood)
        
    4. Sons’ wives (continuity of future seed)
        

> This verse formalizes the **remnant of humanity** — eight souls through whom **a new world will begin** (cf. 1 Peter 3:20).

---

**“Into the ark, because of the waters of the flood”**

- **מִפְּנֵי (mipnei)** — “on account of / in the face of” — not fear-driven, but **obedience-driven**.
    
- This act is not reactionary; Noaḥ enters **before the waters come**, in response to YHWH’s Word (Genesis 7:4).
    

> It is a **faith response to unseen judgment**, exactly as described in **Hebrews 11:7**.

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Some portray this moment sentimentally — but the text shows **precise timing and full household obedience**.
    
- The **centrality of family** in this verse is often overlooked in theological readings — but covenant structures always begin with households (cf. Abraham, Exodus, Acts 16).
    

> This is not just salvation from judgment — it’s the **preservation of divine order** through a faithful house.

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**17th day, 2nd month, AM 1656** (based on Genesis 7:11)

- The ark is sealed shortly after this — the **judgment is now moments away**.

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons’ wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.”

**YLT:**  
“And Noah goeth in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons’ wives with him, unto the ark, because of the waters of the deluge.”

**NIV:**  
“And Noah and his sons and his wife and his sons’ wives entered the ark to escape the waters of the flood.”

> NIV adds “to escape” — interpretively valid, but not explicit in the Hebrew. KJV and YLT follow the original rhythm more closely.

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

- **Genesis 19:16–17** — Lot and his family are urged to leave Sodom; another family remnant preserved before fire.
    
- **Exodus 12:37** — Israelites leave Egypt in family units — divine deliverance always involves the household.
    
- **1 Peter 3:20** — only “eight souls were saved through water,” a verse explicitly tied to **baptism as antitype**.
    

> Genesis 7:7 records the **last steps into refuge** — the sealing of a faithful family inside the vessel of salvation, as the world outside waits for judgment.
