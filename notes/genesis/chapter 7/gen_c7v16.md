### **GENESIS 7:16**

_Scroll of Noaḥ_  
(Traditional Genesis 7:16)

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And those going in, male and female of all flesh, went in as Elohim had commanded him — and YHWH shut him in.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וְהַבָּאִים  
זָכָר וּנְקֵבָה  
מִכָּל בָּשָׂר  
בָּאוּ כַּאֲשֶׁר צִוָּה אֹתוֹ אֱלֹהִים  
וַיִּסְגֹּר יְהוָה בַּעֲדוֹ

---

#### Transliteration:

_Ve’habba’im,  
zakhar u’neqevah  
mikkol basar,  
bau ka’asher tzivvah oto Elohim;  
vayisgor YHWH ba’ado._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And they that entered went in male and female of all flesh, as God commanded Noe; and the Lord God shut the ark outside of him.”

> LXX is close to MT, with **“shut the ark”** capturing the action but slightly less personal than **“shut him in.”**

---

#### DSS (4QGen):

Matches MT precisely. The key phrase **וַיִּסְגֹּר יְהוָה בַּעֲדוֹ** (“YHWH shut him in”) is fully preserved, emphasizing **divine sealing**.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“Those going in, male and female of all flesh…”**

- This final recap echoes vv. 9 and 15 — completing the **entry narrative** with **solemn symmetry**.
    
- The phrase **“of all flesh”** again ties back to Genesis 6:17 and 7:4 — reminding us this is about **preservation amid universal judgment**.
    

---

**“As Elohim had commanded him…”**

- Noaḥ’s obedience and YHWH’s sovereign plan remain perfectly aligned — **complete compliance**, **no deviation**.
    

> The repetition underscores the **covenantal integrity** of the moment.

---

**“And YHWH shut him in” (וַיִּסְגֹּר יְהוָה בַּעֲדוֹ)**

- **סָגַר (sagar)** — to shut, enclose, seal
    
- **בַּעֲדוֹ (baʿado)** — literally “around him” or “on his behalf”
    

> This is not just closure — it is **divine protection**. The ark is sealed **not by man’s hand, but by YHWH’s**.

- This sealing echoes:
    
    - **Exodus 12** — the blood-marked houses of Israel, passed over in judgment
        
    - **Revelation 7:3–4** — the sealing of the righteous before wrath is unleashed
        

> Once sealed, no one enters. No one leaves. The time for mercy is over — **judgment has begun**.

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- This powerful phrase is often passed over — but it is **the theological climax of the ark narrative**:
    
    - The righteous remnant obeys
        
    - YHWH personally seals them in
        
    - The world outside faces wrath
        

> It is a foreshadow of the **spiritual ark to come** — **sealed by God**, **inaccessible from outside**, but open to all who respond **before the door closes**.

---

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**17th day, 2nd month, AM 1656 — same day the Flood begins**

- This verse **ends the grace period** and **initiates irreversible judgment**.
    

---

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as God had commanded him: and the LORD shut him in.”

**YLT:**  
“And they that are coming in, male and female of all flesh, have come in as God hath commanded him, and Jehovah doth close it for him.”

**NIV:**  
“The animals going in were male and female of every living thing, as God had commanded Noah. Then the LORD shut him in.”

> All preserve the core moment. KJV best captures the **poetic gravity** of “the LORD shut him in.”

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

- **Matthew 25:10** — “and the door was shut…” — parallel to the wise virgins entering the wedding feast, while others are shut out.
    
- **Isaiah 26:20** — “Come, my people, enter your rooms and shut the doors behind you… until the indignation is past.”
    
- **Ephesians 1:13–14** — the Holy Spirit as a **seal** of salvation — **Noaḥ was sealed in physically; believers are sealed spiritually.**
    

> Genesis 7:16 is the **divine act of separation** — the sealing of the faithful, the beginning of the end for the world outside.
