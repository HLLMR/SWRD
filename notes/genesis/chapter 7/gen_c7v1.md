## Chapter 7

### The Flood Comes

#### **GENESIS 7:1**

_Traditional Genesis 7:1_

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And YHWH said to Noaḥ, “Come into the ark, you and all your household, for I have seen you as righteous before Me in this generation.”**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וַיֹּאמֶר יְהוָה לְנֹחַ  
בֹּא־אַתָּה וְכָל־בֵּיתְךָ אֶל־הַתֵּבָה  
כִּי־אֹתְךָ רָאִיתִי צַדִּיק לְפָנַי  
בַּדּוֹר הַזֶּה

---

#### Transliteration:

_Vayyomer YHWH le’Noaḥ,  
bo attah ve’khol beitekha el-hatevah,  
ki otkha ra’iti tzaddiq lefanai  
ba’dor hazeh._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And the Lord God said to Noe, Enter thou and all thy house into the ark; for thee have I seen righteous before Me in this generation.”

> LXX remains close to MT, retaining personal address and covenantal emphasis on **“before Me”** — divine sight as **witness and judgment**.

---

#### DSS (4QGen):

No deviation. All core components — YHWH’s command, Noaḥ’s household, and the declaration of righteousness — are preserved.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“And YHWH said to Noaḥ…”**

- **This is the final divine instruction before judgment begins.**
    
- Transition from **construction and preparation** to **entry and sealing**.
    

---

**“Come into the ark, you and all your household”**

- Hebrew **“bo” (come)** — not “go.”
    

> Indicates **YHWH’s presence is within the ark**, not outside it. This is an **invitation into covenantal covering**, not a dispatch into isolation.

- **כָּל־בֵּיתְךָ (kol beitekha)** — all your household — confirms the **covenantal covering of family** under the headship of the righteous.
    

---

**“For I have seen you righteous before Me in this generation”**

- **רָאִיתִי (ra’iti)** — “I have seen” — again, divine witness language. Echoes earlier judgment (6:5, 6:12) but now applies to **righteousness**, not corruption.
    
- Noaḥ’s righteousness is:
    
    - **Before Me (לְפָנַי)** — not public performance, but internal and relational.
        
    - **In this generation (בַּדּוֹר הַזֶּה)** — his context was violent and defiled, making his righteousness all the more **distinct and precious**.
        

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Some traditions frame Noaḥ’s salvation as **earned** — but this continues the pattern from 6:8–9:
    
    - First, **grace**
        
    - Then, **righteousness**
        
    - Then, **obedience**
        
    - Now, **invitation into safety**
        

> Noaḥ’s entry into the ark is not a reward — it’s the **fruit of a covenant walk**.

---

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Very beginning of AM 1656**

- This is **the day of entry**. In seven days, the **Flood will begin** (v. 4).
    
- Noaḥ is **600 years old** (cf. v. 6), and the final divine invitation is now open.

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And the LORD said unto Noah, Come thou and all thy house into the ark; for thee have I seen righteous before me in this generation.”

**YLT:**  
“And Jehovah saith to Noah, ‘Come in, thou and all thy house, unto the ark, for thee I have seen righteous before Me in this generation.’”

**NIV:**  
“The LORD then said to Noah, ‘Go into the ark, you and your whole family, because I have found you righteous in this generation.’”

> NIV’s “Go” misses the **presence nuance** of “Come.” KJV and YLT better preserve the **invitation** into divine protection.

---

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

- **Genesis 19:12** — Lot is likewise told to bring his household out of judgment; both men serve as **righteous remnants** amid destruction.
    
- **Acts 16:31** — “You will be saved, you and your household” — echoes the covenant logic seen here.
    
- **Hebrews 11:7** — “By faith Noaḥ… prepared an ark for the saving of his house…”
    

> Genesis 7:1 is not just a move-in day — it’s the **summons of salvation**, the **gate of the remnant**, and the **threshold of judgment**.
