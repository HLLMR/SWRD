### **GENESIS 7:14–15**

_Scroll of Noaḥ_  
(Traditional Genesis 7:14–15)

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**14.** They and every beast after its kind, and all the livestock after their kind, and every creeping thing that creeps upon the earth after its kind, and every flying creature after its kind — every bird of every sort.  
**15.** And they went in to Noaḥ into the ark, two by two of all flesh in which is the breath of life.

#### Hebrew (MT):

**14**  
הֵמָּה וְכָל־הַחַיָּה לְמִינָהּ  
וְכָל־הַבְּהֵמָה לְמִינָהּ  
וְכָל־הָרֶמֶשׂ הָרוֹמֵשׂ עַל־הָאָרֶץ לְמִינֵהוּ  
וְכָל־הָעוֹף לְמִינֵהוּ  
כֹּל צִפּוֹר כָּל־כָּנָף

**15**  
וַיָּבֹאוּ אֶל־נֹחַ  
אֶל־הַתֵּבָה  
שְׁנַיִם שְׁנַיִם מִכָּל־הַבָּשָׂר  
אֲשֶׁר־בּוֹ רוּחַ חַיִּים

#### Transliteration:

**14**  
_Hemmah ve’khol haḥayyah leminah,  
ve’khol habehemah leminah,  
ve’khol ha’remes haromes ʿal ha’aretz le’minehu,  
ve’khol haʿof le’minehu —  
kol tzippor kol kanaph._

**15**  
_Vayyavo’u el-Noaḥ  
el-hatevah —  
shnayim shnayim mikol habasar  
asher-bo ruach ḥayyim._

#### LXX (Brenton):

**14.** “They and all the wild beasts after their kind, and all the cattle after their kind, and every reptile creeping on the earth after its kind, and every bird after its kind, and every bird of every wing.”  
**15.** “And they entered into the ark to Noe, two by two of all flesh in which is the breath of life.”

> The LXX preserves the **repetition and taxonomy**, affirming the ordered entry of life according to creation categories.

---

#### DSS (4QGen):

No variations from MT. The parallel structure of “after its kind” and “two by two” is deliberately reinforced.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**Verse 14 — Creation Order Reaffirmed**

- A full procession:
    
    - **Wild animals (חַיָּה)**
        
    - **Domesticated livestock (בְּהֵמָה)**
        
    - **Creeping things (רֶמֶשׂ)**
        
    - **Birds (עוֹף / צִפּוֹר)**
        

> Each kind is grouped by **min (species-family category)** — echoing **Genesis 1:20–25**.

- **“Every bird of every wing”** — poetic redundancy for emphasis. Not one type omitted.
    

> This reflects the **thoroughness and symmetry of divine preservation**.

---

**Verse 15 — “They came to Noaḥ…”**

- **וַיָּבֹאוּ (vayyavo’u)** — third-person plural, passive movement. **Noaḥ does not gather them** — they **come as sent** by YHWH (cf. Genesis 6:20).
    
- **שְׁנַיִם שְׁנַיִם (shnayim shnayim)** — two by two — pattern continues with symmetry and order.
    
- **“Of all flesh in which is the breath of life”**
    
    - Reinforces that these are not just animals, but **soulish beings**, nephesh life (cf. Genesis 2:7).
        

> This is not only biological preservation — it is **spiritual continuity** through **divinely animated life**.

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Critics argue the text is redundant or mythic, but the repetition is **literary and theological**:
    
    - It emphasizes **creation’s submission**
        
    - Reflects the **structure and intentionality of YHWH’s plan**
        

> What man has corrupted, YHWH now preserves — not haphazardly, but **meticulously and categorically**.

---

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**17th day, 2nd month, AM 1656**

- These verses describe the **final animal entry**, immediately preceding the closing of the ark (v. 16) and the escalation of the Flood.

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
14. “They, and every beast after his kind, and all the cattle after their kind… and every fowl after his kind, every bird of every sort.”  
15. “And they went in unto Noah into the ark, two and two of all flesh, wherein is the breath of life.”

**YLT:**  
14. “They, and every living thing after its kind… and every fowl after its kind, every bird — every wing.”  
15. “And they come in unto Noah, unto the ark, two by two of all the flesh in which is a living spirit.”

**NIV:**  
14. “They had with them every wild animal according to its kind… every bird, every winged creature.”  
15. “Pairs of all creatures that have the breath of life in them came to Noah and entered the ark.”

> NIV simplifies taxonomy; KJV and YLT retain Hebrew poetic structure better. All agree on **purpose and pattern**.

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

- **Genesis 1:24–31** — creation “according to its kind”; this is now **preserved according to its kind**.
    
- **Genesis 9:9–10** — covenant will later be confirmed not only with man, but **with “every living creature that is with you.”**
    
- **Romans 8:21** — creation itself will be set free — here, it is **preserved** in anticipation of that future redemption.
    

> Genesis 7:14–15 shows the **ark as a microcosm of creation** — orderly, diverse, and blessed — awaiting rebirth after the flood.
