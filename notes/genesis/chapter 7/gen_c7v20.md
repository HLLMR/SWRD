### **GENESIS 7:20**

_Scroll of Noaḥ_  
(Traditional Genesis 7:20)

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**Fifteen cubits upward the waters prevailed; and the mountains were covered.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

חֲמֵשׁ־עֶשְׂרֵה אַמָּה מִלְמַעְלָה  
גָּבְרוּ הַמַּיִם  
וַיְכֻסּוּ הֶהָרִים

---

#### Transliteration:

_Ḥamesh-ʿesreh ammah milmaʿlah  
gavru hamayim,  
vayekussu he’harim._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“The waters rose fifteen cubits above the mountains, and they were covered.”

> LXX confirms the reading: **fifteen cubits above the mountain peaks** — enough to ensure **total submersion**.

---

#### DSS (4QGen):

No deviation from MT. The numerical detail is preserved, affirming its **structural and theological importance**.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“Fifteen cubits upward…”**

- **חֲמֵשׁ־עֶשְׂרֵה אַמָּה (ḥamesh-ʿesreh ammah)** — fifteen cubits = ~22.5 feet (~7 meters)
    
- This is likely:
    
    - The **height of the ark’s draft** (how deep it sat in water), OR
        
    - The **minimum water depth above the tallest mountain**
        

> Either way, it signifies that the **highest point of land was submerged** well beyond the point of visibility or escape.

---

**“The waters prevailed…”**

- Continues the verbal chain from vv. 17–19: **the waters multiply, prevail, overpower**
    

> The flood is unstoppable — it has now **subsumed the world’s entire geography**.

---

**“And the mountains were covered”**

- Hebrew verb: **וַיְכֻסּוּ (vayekussu)** — “they were covered, concealed, overwhelmed”
    

> The mountains — ancient symbols of **stability and endurance** — are now **erased from sight**.

> This completes the **reversal of Genesis 1:9–10**, where dry land emerged. Here, it is **entirely submerged** again.

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Some claim this refers to **local terrain** — but the **fifteen-cubit** detail makes no sense unless applied **globally**:
    
    - Why would the ark need to float fifteen cubits above **already flooded hills**?
        
    - The ark is massive (Genesis 6:15); the water must be deep enough to clear **the tallest elevations**.
        

> This is a **cosmic-scale reset** — not a Mesopotamian storm.

---

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**~Day 30–40 of the Flood**

- The floodwaters have now reached **maximum elevation**, and the ark is fully afloat above a drowned world.

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains were covered.”

**YLT:**  
“Fifteen cubits upwards have the waters become mighty, and the mountains are covered.”

**NIV:**  
“The waters rose and covered the mountains to a depth of more than fifteen cubits.”

> NIV adds “more than,” which is interpretive but aligns with **“prevailed”** suggesting a minimum of fifteen cubits.

---

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

- **Exodus 15:5** — “The depths covered them; they sank to the bottom…” — another poetic echo of **divine drowning judgment**.
    
- **Job 12:15** — “He sends out the waters, and they overwhelm the earth…”
    
- **2 Peter 3:6** — “The world that then existed was deluged with water and perished.”
    

> Genesis 7:20 is the final nail: **not one peak remained.** The old world was fully buried beneath the judgment of YHWH.
