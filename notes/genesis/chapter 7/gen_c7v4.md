### **GENESIS 7:4**

_Scroll of Noaḥ_  
(Traditional Genesis 7:4)

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights; and I will blot out from upon the face of the ground every living thing that I have made.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

כִּי לְיָמִים עוֹד שִׁבְעָה  
אָנֹכִי מַמְטִיר עַל־הָאָרֶץ  
אַרְבָּעִים יוֹם וְאַרְבָּעִים לָיְלָה  
וּמָחִיתִי אֶת־כָּל־הַיְקוּם  
אֲשֶׁר עָשִׂיתִי  
מֵעַל פְּנֵי הָאֲדָמָה

---

#### Transliteration:

_Ki le’yamim ʿod shivʿah  
anokhi mamtir ʿal-ha’aretz  
arbaʿim yom ve’arbaʿim laylah,  
u’machiti et kol ha’yequm  
asher asiti  
meʿal penei ha’adamah._

#### LXX (Brenton):

“For yet seven days, bringing I will bring rain upon the earth for forty days and forty nights, and I will blot out every living thing that I have made from off the face of the earth.”

> LXX aligns closely, with a slight poetic inversion of verbs. The phrase **“every living thing I have made”** retains the language of **creator-judge**.

---

#### DSS (4QGen):

Affirms the MT structure. No variants noted in the final warning timeline or judgment declaration.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“For yet seven days…”**

- **לְיָמִים עוֹד שִׁבְעָה** — “for yet seven more days” — a **grace period** before judgment.
    

> A final **week of mercy**, echoing the **creation week** — a poetic symmetry as creation now collapses back into chaos.

- This could also be when **Methuselah died**, according to some Jewish traditions (cf. meaning of his name: “his death shall bring [it]”).
    

---

**“I will cause it to rain forty days and forty nights”**

- First explicit use of **“rain” (מַמְטִיר)** in the Flood account — earlier it was **“waters,” “flood,” “deep”**.
    

> This introduces the **heavenly dimension** of the deluge — **judgment comes from above**, not just below (cf. Genesis 7:11).

- **Forty days and nights**: Biblically symbolic of:
    
    - **Trial and testing** (Exodus 24:18, Matthew 4:2)
        
    - **Transition and judgment**
        

---

**“I will blot out every living thing…”**

- **וּמָחִיתִי אֶת־כָּל־הַיְקוּם (u’machiti et kol ha’yequm)** — “I will wipe out all existence.”
    
- **הַיְקוּם (ha’yequm)** — literally “that which rises/stands” — i.e., **animated life**.
    

> This term is used specifically in Flood judgment passages and implies **wiping clean the living fabric of the world**.

---

**“From the face of the ground”**

- Repeats judgment formula from Genesis 6:7 and 6:17 — invoking the imagery of **cosmic reset**, not just localized loss.
    

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Some try to read this “seven days” symbolically or liturgically — but the Hebrew is **precise and literal**.
    

> This is a **final, literal, scheduled judgment**. No allegory — the countdown has begun.

---

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Beginning of AM 1656 — seven days before the Flood**

- The ark is complete, provisions stored, animals arriving — this is **YHWH’s last spoken warning before the rains begin**.

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights; and every living substance that I have made will I destroy from off the face of the earth.”

**YLT:**  
“‘For after other seven days I am sending rain on the earth forty days and forty nights, and have blotted out all the substance that I have made from off the face of the ground.’”

**NIV:**  
“Seven days from now I will send rain on the earth for forty days and forty nights, and I will wipe from the face of the earth every living creature I have made.”

> KJV/YLT preserve the solemn tone. NIV simplifies phrasing but retains the essential warning structure.

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

- **Genesis 19:12–14** — another seven-day (or similar) warning is given before judgment on Sodom.
    
- **Jonah 3:4** — “Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown…” — same prophetic countdown structure.
    
- **Revelation 2:21** — “I gave her space to repent…” — divine patience always precedes final judgment.
    

> Genesis 7:4 is the final bell — mercy is extended for seven more days, then **uncreation begins**.
