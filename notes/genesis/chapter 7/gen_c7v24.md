### **GENESIS 7:24**

_Scroll of Noaḥ_  
(Traditional Genesis 7:24)

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And the waters prevailed upon the earth for one hundred and fifty days.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וַיִּגְבְּרוּ הַמַּיִם  
עַל־הָאָרֶץ  
חֲמִשִּׁים וּמְאַת יוֹם

---

#### Transliteration:

_Vayyigberu hamayim  
ʿal ha’aretz  
ḥamishim u’me’at yom._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And the water was raised over the earth a hundred and fifty days.”

> The LXX confirms the **duration** and the **dominance** of the waters.

---

#### DSS (4QGen):

Confirms the MT — the 150-day figure is clearly stated and structurally important in the flood chronology.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“The waters prevailed…” (וַיִּגְבְּרוּ הַמַּיִם)**

- **גָּבַר (gavar)** — to overcome, become mighty, dominate
    

> This word has been used repeatedly (vv. 18–20) to show the **increasing control** of the waters. Here, they **hold dominion for 150 days** — not just rise, but **remain in power**.

---

**“Upon the earth…” (עַל־הָאָרֶץ)**

- Global scope reaffirmed — this is not about local flooding, but **planetary domination**.
    

---

**“One hundred and fifty days…”**

- Hebrew: **חֲמִשִּׁים וּמְאַת יוֹם** — literally “fifty and one hundred days”
    
- Marks a **precise duration**:
    
    - **40 days of rain** (Genesis 7:12, 17)
        
    - **110 days of sustained flooding** with no landfall or recession
        

> This 150-day span ends in **Genesis 8:3**, when the waters begin to recede — making this a **structured midpoint** in the Flood narrative.

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Many assume the Flood lasted only 40 days — but the text lays out **a complex, deliberate timeline**:
    
    - 40 days of rain
        
    - 150 days of water prevailing
        
    - 150 days of recession
        
    - Final drying months
        

> Total time on the ark? **~1 solar year** (Genesis 8:13–14). The 150 days here mark **the peak of divine judgment** — the **age of drowning**.

---

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**From the 17th day of the 2nd month to the 17th day of the 7th month, AM 1656**

- This verse marks the **completion of the active flooding phase** — **peak water level sustained**, awaiting recession.
    

---

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty days.”

**YLT:**  
“And the waters are mighty on the earth a hundred and fifty days.”

**NIV:**  
“The waters flooded the earth for a hundred and fifty days.”

> All are accurate. KJV and YLT maintain the emphasis on the waters’ **strength and dominance**. NIV generalizes but conveys duration.

---

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

- **Genesis 8:3–4** — 150 days later, the ark comes to rest; this is **structural foreshadowing**.
    
- **Daniel 7:25** — times and seasons under divine control — here, the **exact count of days** reinforces that **YHWH governs judgment, not chaos**.
    
- **Revelation 9:5** — another 150-day torment is mentioned, connecting **judgment durations** across dispensations.
    

> Genesis 7:24 closes the chapter with solemn finality — **the world has drowned, and the waters rule**. Only the ark floats, bearing the hope of a new world.
