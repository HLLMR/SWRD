### **GENESIS 7:2–3**

_Scroll of Noaḥ_  
(Traditional Genesis 7:2–3)

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**2.** Of every clean beast you shall take for yourself seven pairs — a male and his mate; and of the beast that is not clean, two — a male and his mate.  
**3.** Also of the flying creature of the heavens, seven pairs — male and female — to keep seed alive on the face of all the earth.

#### Hebrew (MT):

**2**  
מִכֹּל הַבְּהֵמָה הַטְּהוֹרָה תִּקַּח לְךָ שִׁבְעָה שִׁבְעָה  
אִישׁ וְאִשְׁתּוֹ  
וּמִן־הַבְּהֵמָה אֲשֶׁר לֹא טְהֹרָה הִוא  
שְׁנַיִם אִישׁ וְאִשְׁתּוֹ

**3**  
גַּם מֵע֣וֹף הַשָּׁמַ֗יִם  
שִׁבְעָה שִׁבְעָ֙ה֙  
זָכָ֣ר וּנְקֵבָ֔ה  
לְחַיּ֥וֹת זֶ֖רַע  
עַל־פְּנֵ֥י כָל־הָאָֽרֶץ

#### Transliteration:

**2**  
_Mikkol habehemah hat’horah tiqqach lekha shivʿah shivʿah,  
ish ve’ishto;  
u’min habehemah asher lo tehorah hi,  
shnayim — ish ve’ishto._

**3**  
_Gam me’of hashamayim  
shivʿah shivʿah,  
zakhar u’neqevah —  
leḥayyot zeraʿ  
ʿal-penei kol ha’aretz._

#### LXX (Brenton):

**2.** “And of the clean cattle take in to thee sevens, male and female; and of the unclean cattle pairs, male and female.”  
**3.** “And of the flying creatures of the sky sevens, male and female, to preserve seed upon all the earth.”

> LXX agrees with MT in pairing logic and purpose — though "sevens" (hepta hepta) could be read ambiguously as 7 or 7 pairs. The Hebrew “שִׁבְעָה שִׁבְעָה” clarifies: **seven of each sex** = **seven pairs**.

---

#### DSS (4QGen):

Confirmed to match MT — the distinction between clean and unclean animals **predates Sinai** and is embedded in the **antediluvian covenant logic**.

---

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**Clean vs. Unclean Distinction**

- **First appearance in Scripture** of “clean (טָהוֹר)” and “unclean (לֹא טְהוֹרָה)” beasts.
    
- This distinction is not explained here but is assumed to be **already understood by Noaḥ** — likely passed down orally from Adam or directly taught by YHWH.
    

> Demonstrates that **YHWH’s standards preceded Sinai** — moral and ritual categories were known early.

---

**“Seven pairs” of clean animals**

- **שִׁבְעָה שִׁבְעָה (shivʿah shivʿah)** — idiomatic for **seven males and seven females** (i.e., **seven pairs**, not seven individuals).
    
- Preserves a larger number of clean animals for:
    
    - **Post-Flood sacrifice** (Genesis 8:20)
        
    - **Dietary use** (eventually, Genesis 9:3)
        
    - **Faster ecological repopulation**
        

---

**“Two” of unclean animals**

- Only **one pair** of each kind preserved — minimal viable population for post-Flood continuation.
    

> Suggests that **unclean animals were preserved for ecological balance**, not sacrificial or dietary purpose.

---

**“Of the flying creature of the heavens…”**

- Birds follow same rule as clean animals: **seven pairs**, not just one.
    
- Flying creatures play key roles in:
    
    - **Repopulation across continents**
        
    - **Post-Flood navigation (e.g., the dove and raven)**
        
    - **Seed distribution** — hinted in “to keep seed alive”
        

---

**“To preserve seed upon the face of all the earth”**

- **זֶרַע (zeraʿ)** — seed, offspring, future generation
    

> The ark’s mission isn’t just survival — it is **generational continuity**. It’s a **biological reboot** of creation.

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Many retellings gloss over this distinction and suggest “two of each animal” only — but the Hebrew is explicit: **seven pairs of clean, two of unclean**.
    
- Some traditions assert the clean/unclean system began at Sinai — but these verses clearly show it was **antediluvian and covenantal**, not Mosaic and legalistic.
    

---

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Seven days before the Flood (Genesis 7:4)**

- These are **final loading instructions** — part of the divine plan to ensure ecological, sacrificial, and dietary continuity after the judgment.

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
2. “Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens, the male and his female…”  
3. “Of fowls also of the air by sevens, the male and the female…”

**YLT:**  
2. “Of all the clean beasts take to thee seven and seven, a male and his female…”  
3. “Also of fowl of the heavens seven and seven, a male and a female…”

**NIV:**  
2. “Take with you seven pairs of every kind of clean animal, a male and its mate…”  
3. “and also seven pairs of every kind of bird, male and female…”

> The **NIV correctly clarifies “seven pairs”** where KJV and YLT leave ambiguity. Hebrew idiom supports the NIV reading.

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

- **Genesis 8:20** — Noaḥ sacrifices clean animals, proving this distinction matters for worship.
    
- **Leviticus 11** — later codifies clean vs. unclean for Israel, but Genesis 7 shows this was **not invented at Sinai**, but **formalized there**.
    
- **Acts 10:14–15** — Peter’s vision of clean/unclean is rooted in this ancient system — further showing its long theological arc.
    

> This pair of verses showcases **YHWH’s foresight and Noaḥ’s trusted role** in stewarding the future of the post-Flood world.
