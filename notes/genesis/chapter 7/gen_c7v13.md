### **GENESIS 7:13**

_Scroll of Noaḥ_  
(Traditional Genesis 7:13)

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**On that very day, Noaḥ entered — and Shem, and Ḥam, and Yapheth, the sons of Noaḥ, and Noaḥ’s wife, and the three wives of his sons with them — into the ark.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

בְּעֶצֶם הַיּוֹם הַזֶּה  
בָּא נֹחַ  
וְשֵׁם וְחָם וְיָפֶת בְּנֵי־נֹחַ  
וְאֵשֶׁת נֹחַ  
וּשְׁלֹשֶׁת נְשֵׁי בָנָיו אִתָּם  
אֶל־הַתֵּבָה

---

#### Transliteration:

_Be’etzem ha’yom hazeh  
ba Noaḥ,  
ve’Shem, ve’Ḥam, ve’Yapheth b’nei Noaḥ,  
ve’eshet Noaḥ,  
u’sheloshet n’shei vanav ittam  
el-hatevah._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“On that very day entered Noe, Sem, Cham, Japheth, the sons of Noe, and the wife of Noe, and the three wives of his sons with him, into the ark.”

> The LXX mirrors the MT closely. The structure emphasizes the **solemn formality** of this final boarding moment.

---

#### DSS (4QGen):

Confirms the MT with no notable variation. The phrase **“on that very day” (בְּעֶצֶם הַיּוֹם הַזֶּה)** is preserved in its emphatic form.

---

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“On that very day” (בְּעֶצֶם הַיּוֹם הַזֶּה)**

- Used elsewhere in critical covenant moments (e.g. **Exodus 12:51**, **Deuteronomy 32:48**).
    

> This is a **formal timestamp**, signaling that what follows is not incidental — it's **a divinely appointed event executed precisely on schedule**.

---

**Full Household Entry Repeated**

- Every individual listed by role:
    
    - **Noaḥ** — righteous remnant and covenant mediator
        
    - **Shem, Ḥam, Yapheth** — the **new patriarchal lineages** of the world
        
    - **Noaḥ’s wife** — unspoken yet preserved (tradition: Naamah, cf. Genesis 4:22)
        
    - **Three wives of his sons** — the **mothers of the post-Flood nations**
        

> Eight total souls, as affirmed in **1 Peter 3:20** — the remnant preserved through water.

---

**Structure Matters**

- The verse mirrors Genesis 6:18 and 7:7 but adds **emphasis through repetition and order** — echoing the **sacred process of tabernacle entry** (cf. Exodus 40).
    
- Each name and title is **given honor and identity** — none are anonymous before YHWH.
    

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- The **precision and solemnity** of this verse are often overlooked — but it frames the **turning of the ages**.
    

> This isn’t just a family going on a boat trip — it’s the **passing through of judgment into a new world**, perfectly timed and fully accounted for.

---

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**17th day, 2nd month, AM 1656 — same day the Flood began**  
(cf. Genesis 7:11)

> This verse serves as the **official entry log** for the remnant generation.

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“In the selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah’s wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, into the ark.”

**YLT:**  
“In this self-same day went in Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, sons of Noah, and Noah’s wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, into the ark.”

**NIV:**  
“On that very day Noah and his sons, Shem, Ham and Japheth, together with his wife and the wives of his three sons, entered the ark.”

> KJV and YLT retain the **legal-covenantal language** (“selfsame day”). NIV simplifies but loses the rhetorical force.

---

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

- **Genesis 2:1–3** — YHWH completes and sanctifies the seventh day — here, **a new “rest” is beginning**, but through water and judgment.
    
- **Exodus 12:41** — “And it came to pass at the end of the 430 years, even the selfsame day…” — divine timing in exodus and judgment always exact.
    
- **Luke 17:27** — “They entered the ark, and the flood came…” — a stark reminder of sudden judgment and narrow deliverance.
    

> Genesis 7:13 marks the **final entry into salvation** — no more warnings, no more delay. The door is about to close.
