### **GENESIS 7:8–9**

_Scroll of Noaḥ_  
(Traditional Genesis 7:8–9)

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**8.** Of the clean beasts, and of the beasts that are not clean, and of the flying creatures, and of everything that creeps upon the ground —  
**9.** two by two, they came to Noaḥ into the ark, male and female, as Elohim had commanded Noaḥ.

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

**8**  
מִן־הַבְּהֵמָה הַטְּהוֹרָה  
וּמִן־הַבְּהֵמָה אֲשֶׁר אֵינֶנָּה טְהֹרָה  
וּמִן־הָעוֹף  
וְכֹל אֲשֶׁר־רוֹמֵשׂ עַל־הָאֲדָמָה

**9**  
שְׁנַיִם שְׁנַיִם בָּאוּ אֶל־נֹחַ  
אֶל־הַתֵּבָה  
זָכָר וּנְקֵבָה  
כַּאֲשֶׁר צִוָּה אֱלֹהִים אֶת־נֹחַ

#### Transliteration:

**8**  
_Min-habehemah hat’horah,  
u’min-habehemah asher eineinah tehorah,  
u’min-ha’of,  
ve’khol asher romes ʿal ha’adamah —_

**9**  
_Shnayim shnayim bau el-Noaḥ  
el-hatevah —  
zakhar u’neqevah,  
ka’asher tzivvah Elohim et-Noaḥ._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

**8.** “And of the clean cattle, and of the cattle that are not clean, and of the birds, and of everything that creeps upon the earth,  
**9.** two and two they went in to Noe into the ark, male and female, as God commanded Noe.”

> The LXX matches the Hebrew taxonomy closely and affirms **divine orchestration of animal entry** — “they went in,” not “he brought them.”

---

#### DSS (4QGen):

DSS aligns with MT — no deviations. The fourfold taxonomy is retained and the repetitive phrasing emphasizes **order, completeness, and obedience**.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**Verse 8 — Four Categories of Animal Life**

- **Clean beasts** (הַטְּהוֹרָה)
    
- **Unclean beasts** (אֵינֶנָּה טְהֹרָה)
    
- **Flying creatures** (הָעוֹף)
    
- **Creeping things on the ground** (רוֹמֵשׂ עַל־הָאֲדָמָה)
    

> These match the categories of **Genesis 1:20–25** and **Leviticus 11** — reaffirming the **creation-to-covenant continuum**.

---

**Verse 9 — “Two by two they came to Noaḥ”**

- Hebrew **שְׁנַיִם שְׁנַיִם (shnayim shnayim)** — rhythmic, poetic emphasis: a **procession of pairs**.
    
- **בָּאוּ (bau)** — “they came” — passive voice; **Noaḥ does not gather them**, Elohim sovereignly sends them.
    
- This reaffirms:
    
    - **Divine agency**
        
    - **Animal submission**
        
    - **Noaḥ’s priestly stewardship**
        

---

**“Male and female, as Elohim had commanded Noaḥ”**

- Repeats Genesis 6:19–20 and 7:2–3.
    
- The **obedience of creation** mirrors Noaḥ’s own obedience — showing that while mankind has rebelled, **the rest of creation still submits** to its Maker.
    

> This echoes the **Edenic harmony**, reestablished briefly in the ark — a **mobile sanctuary of order in a world of chaos**.

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Some modern retellings confuse or collapse the numbers (two of every animal), ignoring the **clean/unclean distinction** and this detailed entry sequence.
    

> These verses are precise because the ark is not a myth — it’s a **carefully orchestrated rescue event**.

---

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**17th day, 2nd month, AM 1656**

- The entry is nearly complete. The next verse (7:10) confirms that the seven-day countdown is now **ending**.

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
8. “Of clean beasts, and of beasts that are not clean, and of fowls, and of every thing that creepeth upon the earth,  
9. There went in two and two unto Noah into the ark, the male and the female, as God had commanded Noah.”

**YLT:**  
8. “Of the clean beasts, and of the beasts that [are] not clean, and of the fowl, and of every thing that is creeping upon the ground,  
9. two by two they have come in unto Noah, unto the ark, a male and a female, as God hath commanded Noah.”

**NIV:**  
8. “Pairs of clean and unclean animals, of birds and of all creatures that move along the ground,  
9. male and female, came to Noah and entered the ark, as God had commanded Noah.”

> All maintain the structure, though NIV simplifies the phrasing. KJV and YLT more closely reflect the **Hebrew order and repetition**.

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

- **Genesis 2:19–20** — animals brought to Adam for naming; here, to Noaḥ for preserving.
    
- **Isaiah 11:6–9** — prophetic picture of restored creation order; the ark anticipates this as a **foreshadowed sanctuary**.
    
- **Romans 8:20–22** — creation groaning under sin, awaiting redemption — here, a **first rescue** of that creation is underway.
    

> This passage captures a **miraculous stillness before the storm** — pairs of animals obeying their Creator, entering the ark of refuge.
