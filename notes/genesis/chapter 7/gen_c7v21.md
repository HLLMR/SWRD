### **GENESIS 7:21**

_Scroll of Noaḥ_  
(Traditional Genesis 7:21)

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And all flesh died that moved upon the earth — among the flying creatures, and among the livestock, and among the beasts, and among every swarming thing that swarms upon the earth — and every man.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וַיִּגְוַע כָּל־בָּשָׂר  
הָרֹמֵשׂ עַל־הָאָרֶץ  
בָּעוֹף וּבַבְּהֵמָה וּבַחַיָּה  
וּבְכָל־הַשֶּׁרֶץ הַשֹּׁרֵץ עַל־הָאָרֶץ  
וְכָל הָאָדָם

---

#### Transliteration:

_Vayyigvaʿ kol-basar  
haromes ʿal ha’aretz —  
baʿof u’vab’heimah u’vachayyah,  
u’ve’khol hasheretz hashoretz ʿal ha’aretz,  
ve’khol ha’adam._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, of flying creatures, and cattle, and wild beasts, and every creeping thing moving upon the earth, and every man.”

> LXX faithfully preserves the full list, culminating with **“every man”** — a structured, universal enumeration of the dead.

---

#### DSS (4QGen):

Text matches MT. The list of categories, like the creation order in Genesis 1, is reversed in judgment.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“All flesh died…” (וַיִּגְוַע כָּל־בָּשָׂר)**

- **גָוַע (gavaʿ)** — to expire, to breathe one’s last
    

> This word is typically used for **personal death** (e.g. patriarchs in Genesis), here applied to **everything living**. This is a **universal death sentence**.

---

**“That moved upon the earth…”**

- Hebrew: **הָרֹמֵשׂ עַל־הָאָרֶץ** — “that creeps/moves/stirs on the land”
    

> Ground-based life forms. The sea life is not included — the judgment is on **land-dwelling nephesh beings**.

---

**“Flying creatures, livestock, beasts, swarming things, and every man”**

- This is the **inverse of Genesis 1:20–26**:
    
    - What YHWH once **formed and filled**, He now **undoes and empties**.
        
- The **order of creation becomes the order of death**.
    

> Even the **air is not safe** — this is total terrestrial collapse.

---

**“Every man” (וְכָל הָאָדָם)**

- The climactic final phrase.
    

> Not merely judgment on animals or ecosystems — but on **humanity**, the image-bearers, corrupted by violence, hybridization, and rebellion.

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Some try to soften this to a local or symbolic judgment — but the verse lists **all terrestrial categories** plus **all humans**, with the verb **“died”** used explicitly.
    

> There is no escape, no survival outside the ark. The text could not be clearer: **judgment was complete**.

---

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**~Day 40 of the Flood** (end of the rain window)

- The floodwaters have now covered everything (v. 20), and this verse reflects the **consequential deaths** that result.

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing… and every man.”

**YLT:**  
“And expire doth all flesh that is moving on the earth, among fowl, and among cattle, and among beast, and among every creeping thing… and all mankind.”

**NIV:**  
“Every living thing that moved on land perished — birds, livestock, wild animals, all the creatures that swarm… and all mankind.”

> All three are faithful. KJV and YLT highlight **“expire”/“died”**, preserving the original gravity.

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

- **Genesis 6:7, 6:17** — predicted this death; now fulfilled in detail.
    
- **Revelation 6:8, 9:15** — later judgments likewise bring **widespread death** on the earth.
    
- **Ecclesiastes 12:7** — “Then the dust will return to the earth… and the spirit to God” — echoes the **finality of gavaʿ**.
    

> Genesis 7:21 marks the **grim harvest** of human and creaturely corruption — a somber echo of the Fall, now reaped in full.
