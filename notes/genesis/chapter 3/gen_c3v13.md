### **GENESIS 3:13**

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

#### Hebrew (MT):

וַיֹּאמֶר יְהוָה אֱלֹהִים לָאִשָּׁה  
מַה־זֹּאת עָשִׂית  
וַתֹּאמֶר הָאִשָּׁה  
הַנָּחָשׁ הִשִּׁיאַנִי  
וָאֹכֵל

---

#### Transliteration:

_Vayomer YHWH Elohim la’ishah,  
mah-zot asit?  
Vattomer ha’ishah,  
ha’nachash hishiani,  
va’okhel._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And the Lord God said to the woman, What is this you have done? And the woman said, The serpent deceived me, and I ate.”

#### DSS (4QGen-Exoda):

No textual deviations; affirms use of _hishiani_ (he deceived me) and maintains YHWH Elohim address format.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“What is this you have done?” (מַה־זֹּאת עָשִׂית)**

- _Mah-zot asit?_ is terse and weighty — a moral question, not merely factual.
    
- Divine inquiry focuses on **action**, not motive — unlike Adam, Eve is confronted **immediately** and directly.
    

**“The serpent deceived me…” (הַנָּחָשׁ הִשִּׁיאַנִי)**

- _Hishiani_ = deceived, beguiled, led astray — indicates **manipulation**, not just suggestion.
    
- The verb suggests psychological manipulation or seduction, but does **not** absolve the woman of choice.
    

**“And I ate.” (וָאֹכֵל)**

- Same clipped construction as Adam’s response — _va’okhel_.
    
- No denial, no justification, no counter-accusation — **confession**, plain and brief.
    

In contrast to Adam, Eve does not blame YHWH or the man. She states what happened, includes the deception, and confesses the act. This is often overlooked — but **her response is more honest** than Adam’s.

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Much of Western theology, especially Augustinian, placed **disproportionate blame** on Eve — despite Paul’s later clarification in 1 Timothy 2:14 that **Adam was not deceived**, but _willfully transgressed_.
    
- YHWH addresses Eve **not with anger**, but with inquiry — preserving justice **with mercy**.

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Anno Mundi 0**, same confrontation sequence. This is the final dialogue before divine sentence is declared on the serpent, the woman, and the man.

---

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And the Lord God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.”

**YLT:**  
“And Jehovah God saith to the woman, ‘What is this thou hast done?’ and the woman saith, ‘The serpent hath caused me to forget — and I do eat.’”

**NIV:**  
“Then the Lord God said to the woman, ‘What is this you have done?’ The woman said, ‘The serpent deceived me, and I ate.’”

_“Beguiled” (KJV) and “deceived” (NIV) reflect _hishiani_ well; YLT’s “caused me to forget” is a rare interpretive outlier not supported by the MT._

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

**2 Corinthians 11:3** — Paul references this moment: “as the serpent deceived Eve by his craftiness…”

**Jubilees 3:36–37** — includes Eve’s testimony before angels and reiterates the deception.

**1 Timothy 2:14** — “And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression.” Eve’s deception is acknowledged, but **culpability differs**.
