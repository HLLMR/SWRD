### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“YHWH Elohim made…” (וַיַּעַשׂ יְהוָה אֱלֹהִים)**

- First instance of **YHWH Elohim acting as a redeemer** — not just as judge.
    
- This act **tempers justice with mercy** — though they are exiled, they are **not left exposed**.
    

**“Garments of skin” (כָּתְנוֹת עוֹר)**

- _Katnot_ = tunics, long shirts or coats.
    
- _Or_ = skin — likely **animal hide**, not human or synthetic material.
    
- Implies **the first physical death** — possibly of a **substitute animal**, shedding blood to cover human shame.
    
    This becomes a **foundational image**:
    
    - Covering → Atonement (_kaphar_)
        
    - Blood → Substitution
        
    - Clothing → Righteousness imputed by God (cf. Zech 3:4; Rev 7:14)
        

**“And clothed them” (וַיַּלְבִּשֵׁם)**

- A deeply **personal and priestly act** — God Himself performs the first **covering of sin**.
    
- Echoed in later themes of God **clothing the naked**, especially in covenantal and messianic contexts.
    

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Some modern interpreters **spiritualize this act**, downplaying the likely **animal death** required — yet the Hebrew does not support metaphor alone.
    
- Catholic and Orthodox traditions often emphasize **fig leaves and penance**, but the **true divine covering** comes from YHWH, **not man’s efforts**.
    
- Protestant theology tends to leap to justification language here (which fits), but sometimes misses the **visual and sacrificial symbolism** that prefigures the **entire Levitical system**.

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Anno Mundi 0**, immediate aftermath of the sentencing. A transitional act between Eden and exile — the **first move toward redemption**.

---

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“Unto Adam also and to his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins, and clothed them.”

**YLT:**  
“And Jehovah God doth make to the man and to his wife coats of skin, and doth clothe them.”

**NIV:**  
“The Lord God made garments of skin for Adam and his wife and clothed them.”

_All three retain the basic structure. NIV generalizes “coats” to “garments,” and avoids the sacrificial undertone._

---

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

**Genesis 4:4** — Abel brings **the firstling of the flock**, likely **patterning this divine act**.

**Leviticus 7–17** — sacrificial system built on **substitutional blood covering**.

**Isaiah 61:10** — “He has clothed me with garments of salvation…” — direct prophetic link.

**Revelation 3:18** — “Buy from Me white garments so that you may clothe yourself…” — symbolic echo of this moment.
