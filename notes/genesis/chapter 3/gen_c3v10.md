### **GENESIS 3:10**

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And he said, “I heard Your voice in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked, and I hid myself.”**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וַיֹּאמֶר  
אֶת־קֹלְךָ שָׁמַעְתִּי בַּגָּן  
וָאִירָא כִּי עֵירֹם אָנֹכִי  
וָאֵחָבֵא

---

#### Transliteration:

_Vayomer,  
et-qol’kha shamati ba’gan,  
va’ira ki eirom anokhi,  
va’eikhave._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And he said to him, I heard your voice as you walked in the garden, and I feared because I was naked, and I hid myself.”

_Slight expansion: LXX includes “as you walked,” not explicit in MT._

---

#### DSS (4QGen-Exoda):

Matches MT exactly — no alterations to the fear-nakedness-confession sequence.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“I heard Your voice…” (אֶת־קֹלְךָ שָׁמַעְתִּי)**

- _Et-qol’kha_ — direct object marker shows Adam is responding personally to **YHWH Elohim’s voice**.
    
- Acknowledges divine presence but pairs it with **terror**, not fellowship.
    

**“I was afraid because I was naked…”**

- This is the **first mention of fear** in Scripture.
    
- Fear enters **immediately after sin** — tied not to punishment, but to **shame** and the exposure of self.
    
- Adam recognizes his nakedness as a spiritual and moral condition, not merely physical.
    

**“I hid myself” (וָאֵחָבֵא)**

- Same root as Gen 3:8 — _to hide_ from presence/face.
    
- Instead of seeking reconciliation, Adam chooses **concealment and avoidance**.
    
- This is the essence of sin’s rupture: **hiding from God rather than returning to Him**.
    

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Traditional theology often sees fear here only as guilt, but the language reflects **relational fracture** — man now perceives God's voice as a threat.
    
- Some mystical traditions twist this into **enlightenment fear** (as if Adam “outgrew” God), but the plain text shows **remorse, vulnerability, and rupture**.

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Anno Mundi 0**, still within the same confrontation. This is the first recorded human confession — though incomplete and deflective, it begins the sequence leading to judgment and exile.

---

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.”

**YLT:**  
“And he saith, ‘Thy voice I have heard in the garden, and I am afraid, for I am naked, and I hide myself.’”

**NIV:**  
“He answered, ‘I heard you in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked; so I hid.’”

_All three preserve the structure and meaning. YLT captures present-tense Hebrew flavor; NIV flows more naturally in English._

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

**Isaiah 59:2** — “Your iniquities have separated you from your God… and your sins have hidden His face from you.”

**Jubilees 3:32–33** — confirms Adam’s fear and retreat; links the act to divine questioning.

**Hebrews 4:13** — “All things are naked and exposed before the eyes of Him to whom we must give account.”
