### **GENESIS 3:17**

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And to Adam He said, “Because you listened to the voice of your wife and ate from the tree of which I commanded you, saying, ‘You shall not eat from it,’ cursed is the ground because of you; in sorrow you shall eat of it all the days of your life.”**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וּלְאָדָם אָמַר  
כִּי שָׁמַעְתָּ לְקוֹל אִשְׁתֶּךָ  
וַתֹּאכַל מִן־הָעֵץ  
אֲשֶׁר צִוִּיתִיךָ לֵאמֹר  
לֹא תֹאכַל מִמֶּנּוּ  
אֲרוּרָה הָאֲדָמָה בַּעֲבוּרֶךָ  
בְּעִצָּבוֹן תֹּאכֲלֶנָּה  
כֹּל יְמֵי חַיֶּיךָ

#### Transliteration:

_U’le’adam amar:  
Ki shamata le’kol ishtekha  
va’tokhal min ha’etz  
asher tzivitikha le’mor  
lo tokhal mimennu —  
arurah ha’adamah ba’avurekha;  
be’itzavon tokhalenah  
kol yemei chayekha._

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And to Adam he said, Because you listened to the voice of your wife, and ate of the tree concerning which I charged you, saying, You shall not eat of it — cursed is the ground in your labors; in pain you shall eat of it all the days of your life.”

_Note: LXX reads “in your labors” rather than “because of you.” Possibly interpretive._

---

#### DSS (4QGen-Exoda):

No variations from the Masoretic in key clauses. _Ba’avurekha_ (“because of you”) is clearly preserved; LXX deviation appears to be editorial.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“Because you listened to the voice of your wife…” (שָׁמַעְתָּ לְקוֹל אִשְׁתֶּךָ)**

- Not a condemnation of partnership — the issue is **listening in contradiction to God’s word**.
    
- The same phrase is used later with Abraham in Gen 21:12 — but there, **God** tells him to listen.
    

**“And ate from the tree…”**

- The core issue: _willful disobedience_ despite direct divine command.
    

**“Cursed is the ground because of you…” (אֲרוּרָה הָאֲדָמָה בַּעֲבוּרֶךָ)**

- _Arurah ha’adamah ba’avurekha_ = “cursed is the soil on account of you.”
    
- First time **the earth itself is cursed** — not man, but his environment.
    

**“In sorrow you shall eat of it…” (בְּעִצָּבוֹן תֹּאכֲלֶנָּה)**

- _Itzavon_ = toil, labor, grief — same root used in Eve’s judgment.
    
- Eating is now linked to **hardship and frustration**, not effortless provision.
    

This sentence introduces **strain into man’s dominion** — he remains steward, but now under **conditions of resistance**.

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Some theologies overemphasize **blame on the woman** while the text places the **curse on the ground due to Adam’s disobedience**.
    
- Catholic doctrine has sometimes interpreted Eve’s influence here as reason for priestly exclusion — a reading unsupported by the judgment structure.
    
- Modern allegorical readings dull the reality: this isn’t metaphor — it’s a **cosmic environmental shift** resulting from moral failure.

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Anno Mundi 0**, third and final judgment in Eden. The narrative structure moves from serpent → woman → man → creation.

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree... cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life.”

**YLT:**  
“And to the man He said, ‘Because thou hast hearkened to the voice of thy wife, and dost eat of the tree... cursed is the ground on thine account; in sorrow thou dost eat of it all days of thy life.’”

**NIV:**  
“To Adam he said, ‘Because you listened to your wife and ate fruit from the tree... cursed is the ground because of you; through painful toil you will eat food from it all the days of your life.’”

_The phrase “fruit from the tree” in NIV is interpretive; not present in the Hebrew. KJV and YLT better preserve the original._

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

**Jubilees 3:24–28** — details the sorrow Adam experienced after this sentence; includes mourning and exile narrative.

**Romans 8:20–22** — “The creation was subjected to futility…” — Paul ties this curse to the **bondage of corruption** now affecting all of creation.

**2 Baruch 56:6** — echoes this theme: “Adam was the cause, and we all come into hardship.”
