### **GENESIS 3:1**

_Traditional Genesis 3:1_

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**Now the serpent was more cunning than any beast of the field which YHWH Elohim had made. And he said to the woman, “Has Elohim really said, ‘You shall not eat from any tree of the garden’?”**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וְהַנָּחָשׁ  
הָיָה עָרוּם מִכֹּל חַיַּת הַשָּׂדֶה  
אֲשֶׁר עָשָׂה יְהוָה אֱלֹהִים  
וַיֹּאמֶר אֶל־הָאִשָּׁה  
אַף כִּי־אָמַר אֱלֹהִים  
לֹא תֹאכְלוּ מִכֹּל עֵץ הַגָּן

---

#### Transliteration:

_Ve’ha’nachash  
hayah arum mikol chayat ha’sadeh  
asher asah YHWH Elohim,  
vayyomer el ha’ishah,  
“Af ki amar Elohim,  
lo tokhlu mikol etz ha’gan?”_

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“But the serpent was the most crafty of all the brutes on the earth, which the Lord God made; and the serpent said to the woman, ‘Why has God said, Eat not of every tree of the garden?’”

_LXX uses “crafty” for _arum_ and “brutes” for _chayat hasadeh_ (field beasts)._

---

#### DSS (4QGen-Exoda):

Matches MT. Confirms _nachash_ (serpent), _arum_ (cunning), and use of _Elohim_ alone in the serpent’s speech — not _YHWH Elohim_.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“The serpent was more cunning…” (הַנָּחָשׁ … עָרוּם)**

- _Nachash_ = serpent — but contextually may imply a **spiritual being** appearing in serpentine form.
    
- _Arum_ = cunning, shrewd — same root wordplay as _arummim_ (“naked”) in 2:25. The innocence of Adam and Chavah is now contrasted with the serpent’s shrewdness.
    
- This wordplay creates **literary tension** — innocence vs. cunning.
    

**“Beast of the field” (חַיַּת הַשָּׂדֶה)**

- Again, this does **not refer to wild predators**, but to **domesticated, non-dangerous creatures** — the serpent blends in among them.
    
- Indicates the serpent was familiar or non-threatening — possibly walked or appeared upright before the curse (see Gen 3:14).
    

**“YHWH Elohim” vs. “Elohim”**

- Narrator uses full covenant name _YHWH Elohim_.
    
- The serpent omits **YHWH**, subtly diminishing the relational aspect of God — the first recorded instance of **theology by omission**.
    

**“Has God really said…” (אַף כִּי־אָמַר)**

- _Af ki_ = “Indeed?” or “Even so?” — introduces **doubt and distortion**.
    
- The serpent **twists the divine command** by exaggerating it: “Shall you not eat of **any** tree?”
    
- A classic tactic: **misrepresent boundaries to provoke resentment**.

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Some traditions downplay the identity of the serpent — but the rest of Scripture (Revelation 12:9, 2 Cor 11:3) explicitly identifies him as **Satan**.
    
- Liberal critics treat this as myth — but the narrative **preserves internal theological logic**: the attack is not on Adam’s body, but on their **trust in the Word of Elohim**.
    
- The omission of _YHWH_ in the serpent’s speech is often overlooked, yet it is **theologically loaded**.

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Anno Mundi 0**, very shortly after the creation of woman. The serpent confronts Chavah directly — likely within days of Eden’s completion.

---

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?”

**YLT:**  
“And the serpent hath been subtile above every beast of the field which Jehovah God hath made, and he saith unto the woman, ‘Is it true that God hath said, Ye do not eat of every tree of the garden?’”

**NIV:**  
“Now the serpent was more crafty than any of the wild animals the LORD God had made. He said to the woman, ‘Did God really say, “You must not eat from any tree in the garden”?’”

_NIV mistranslates “wild animals” — MT reads “field animals,” which are likely domesticated. KJV/YLT better reflect the tone, though all versions struggle to convey _af ki_ nuance._

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

**Jubilees 3:17–22** — provides a parallel narrative of the serpent’s temptation and identifies him as **Mastema**, an adversarial spiritual being.

**Wisdom of Solomon 2:23–24** — attributes death entering the world to the **envy of the devil**, referencing this event.

**Revelation 12:9** — names the serpent explicitly as “that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world.”
