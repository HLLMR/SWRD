### **GENESIS 3:20**

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And the man called his wife’s name Ḥavvah, because she was the mother of all living.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וַיִּקְרָא הָאָדָם שֵׁם אִשְׁתּוֹ חַוָּה  
כִּי הִוא הָיְתָה אֵם כָּל־חָי

---

#### Transliteration:

_Va’yiqra ha’adam shem ishto Ḥavvah,  
ki hi hay’tah em kol-chai._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And Adam called the name of his wife Life, because she was the mother of all living.”

_LXX renders “Ḥavvah” as “Zoe” (Life) — translating the name’s **meaning**, not the sound._

---

#### DSS (4QGen-Exoda):

Matches MT exactly — no significant variants. Confirms both “Ḥavvah” and “mother of all living.”

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“And the man called…” (וַיִּקְרָא הָאָדָם)**

- _Vayiqra_ = “he called/named” — same verb used in earlier acts of dominion (naming animals).
    
- This is **not dominance**, but a **recognition of identity and purpose**.
    

**“Ḥavvah” (חַוָּה)**

- From root _chayah_ (חָיָה) = “to live” — Ḥavvah means _life-giver_ or _living one_.
    
- Related to Aramaic _Ḥawwā_ — from which English “Eve” derives.
    
- This naming is **a faith statement** — spoken _after_ the death sentence, proclaiming **life will continue**.
    

**“Because she was the mother of all living…”**

- _Kol-chai_ = “all life” or “every living thing.”
    
- Refers not only to **future human generations**, but possibly to her **maternal archetype** over creation (compare Gen 4:20–22 lineages).

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- In some traditions, this verse is minimized or skipped to continue blaming the woman — yet Adam honors her **in the wake of sin**, not before.
    
- LXX’s choice to translate her name as _Zoe_ obscures the original **Hebrew wordplay** and deep thematic tie to _life_ and _death_ from prior verses.
    
- Some modern translations incorrectly suggest that Adam named her “Eve” earlier (e.g., Gen 2) — but this naming occurs **only after the fall**.

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Anno Mundi 0**, immediately following the judicial declarations. Marks the first **post-sin act of faith**: naming his wife as the one through whom life will continue.

---

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And Adam called his wife's name Eve; because she was the mother of all living.”

**YLT:**  
“And the man calleth his wife's name Eve: for she hath been mother of all living.”

**NIV:**  
“Adam named his wife Eve, because she would become the mother of all the living.”

_NIV’s “would become” adds a **future tense** not found in the Hebrew. MT and LXX both treat it as **present reality** — not prophetic future._

---

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

**Genesis 4:1–2** — immediate fulfillment of this naming: Eve bears Cain and Abel.

**Jubilees 4:1–9** — elaborates on Adam’s words and the naming of Ḥavvah, including additional children and her grief.

**2 Corinthians 11:3** — Paul refers to “Eve” by name, affirming continuity of identity from MT — not the LXX _Zoe_ tradition.
