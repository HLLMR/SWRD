### **GENESIS 3:24**

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**So He drove out the man; and He placed at the east of the Garden of Eden the cherubim, and the flame of a sword turning every direction, to guard the way to the tree of life.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וַיְגָרֶשׁ אֶת־הָאָדָם  
וַיַּשְׁכֵּן מִקֶּדֶם לְגַן־עֵדֶן  
אֶת־הַכְּרוּבִים  
וְאֵת לַהַט הַחֶרֶב הַמִּתְהַפֶּכֶת  
לִשְׁמֹר אֶת־דֶּרֶךְ עֵץ הַחַיִּים

---

#### Transliteration:

_Vay’garesh et ha’adam;  
vayyashken miqqedem l’gan-ʿEden  
et ha’keruvim  
v’et lahat ha’cherev ha’mithapechet  
lishmor et derekh etz ha’chayyim._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And he cast out Adam and caused him to dwell over against the garden of pleasure, and stationed the cherubim and the flame of the turning sword to keep the way of the tree of life.”

_“Over against” = opposite or to the east. Word order is slightly different but meaning is preserved._

---

#### DSS (4QGen-Exoda):

Fully supports the MT wording. Confirms use of _keruvim_ (cherubim) and _derekh etz hachayyim_ (way to the tree of life).

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“He drove out the man” (וַיְגָרֶשׁ)**

- _Vay’garesh_ = to expel forcibly — stronger than earlier _shalach_ (sent out).
    
- A **formal expulsion from sacred space** — Eden is now off-limits, not simply left behind.
    
- Similar verbs used for **divorce and exile** in later Hebrew usage.
    

**“East of the Garden of Eden” (מִקֶּדֶם לְגַן־עֵדֶן)**

- _Miqedem_ = eastward / from the east — direction is highly symbolic:
    
    - **East = exile direction** throughout Genesis (Cain, Babel, Lot).
        
    - Also implies **hope of return** — Messiah is prophesied to come from the east (cf. Ezek 43:2).
        

**“Cherubim” (הַכְּרוּבִים)**

- _Keruvim_ = plural of _keruv_ — **heavenly throne guardians**, not baby angels.
    
    - Fierce, radiant, and winged — later seen on Ark of the Covenant (Exod 25), and in Ezekiel’s visions.
        
- Their role is **defensive and judicial**, not symbolic or decorative.
    

**“Flaming sword turning every direction” (לַהַט הַחֶרֶב הַמִּתְהַפֶּכֶת)**

- _Lahat_ = flame, possibly whirling or flickering fire.
    
- _Ha’cherev ha’mithapechet_ = the sword that turns, flips, spins — **dynamic and impenetrable**.
    
- Visualizes **divine wrath and protection** — not just a barrier but a living deterrent.
    

**“To guard the way to the tree of life” (לִשְׁמֹר אֶת־דֶּרֶךְ עֵץ הַחַיִּים)**

- _Lishmor_ = to watch, guard, preserve.
    
- The **tree still exists** — but access is **severed**, and only righteous return is permitted.
    
- Sets up entire arc of **redemption history**: exile → atonement → restored access (cf. Rev 22).
    

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Common artistic depictions of cherubim trivialize their fearsome role — they are **throne guardians**, not baby-faced intermediaries.
    
- The sword is often treated symbolically, but Hebrew is clear — this is a **literal flaming, turning weapon** of divine enforcement.
    
- Eden’s location is often allegorized — but this verse emphasizes **direction, geography, and protection**, implying a **real terrestrial site**.

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Anno Mundi 0**, final act of divine judgment post-fall. Humanity is now fully **outside sacred space**, beginning the long arc toward return.

---

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.”

**YLT:**  
“And He casteth out the man, and causeth to dwell at the east of the garden of Eden the cherubs, and the flame of the sword which is turning itself, to guard the way of the tree of life.”

**NIV:**  
“After he drove the man out, he placed on the east side of the Garden of Eden cherubim and a flaming sword flashing back and forth to guard the way to the tree of life.”

_NIV softens “drove out” with “after,” and adds “flashing back and forth” for readability, though it’s not a literal rendering of _mithapechet_._

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

**Ezekiel 10–11** — detailed vision of cherubim as **fiery guardians and throne bearers**.

**Revelation 2:7; 22:2, 14** — the **tree of life restored** to those who overcome and are clothed in righteousness.

**1 Enoch 24–25** — describes a radiant tree at the center of the Holy Mountain, identified as the **Tree of Life** — guarded until the day of judgment.
