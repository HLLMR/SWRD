### **GENESIS 3:5**

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**“For Elohim knows that in the day you eat of it, your eyes will be opened, and you will be like Elohim, knowing good and evil.”**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

כִּי יֹדֵעַ אֱלֹהִים  
כִּי בְּיוֹם אֲכָלְכֶם מִמֶּנּוּ  
וְנִפְקְחוּ עֵינֵיכֶם  
וִהְיִיתֶם כֵּאלֹהִים  
יֹדְעֵי טוֹב וָרָע

---

#### Transliteration:

_Ki yodea Elohim  
ki b’yom akhal’khem mimennu  
v’nifk’chu eineikhem,  
vihyitem ke’Elohim,  
yod’ei tov va’ra._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“For God knew that in whatever day ye should eat of it your eyes would be opened, and ye would be as gods, knowing good and evil.”

_LXX introduces “as gods” (ὡς θεοὶ) rather than “like God” — ambiguous in Greek._

---

#### DSS (4QGen-Exoda):

Conforms to MT in all major respects. Confirms _Elohim_ (not _YHWH Elohim_) used by the serpent again.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“Elohim knows…” (יֹדֵעַ אֱלֹהִים)**

- The serpent claims **God is withholding knowledge** — casting Him as jealous or possessive.
    
- This implies **deceit or manipulation by God**, a direct attack on His nature.
    

**“In the day you eat… your eyes will be opened” (בְּיוֹם אֲכָלְכֶם … וְנִפְקְחוּ עֵינֵיכֶם)**

- _Nifk’chu_ = “will be opened” — a passive verb, suggesting a **supernatural revelation**.
    
- This does occur (Gen 3:7), but the result is **shame and exile**, not enlightenment or glory.
    

**“You will be like Elohim” (וִהְיִיתֶם כֵּאלֹהִים)**

- This is the core lie of **self-deification** — becoming like God **apart from God**.
    
- MT uses _Elohim_ (God/gods), a plural form that can mean:
    
    - **The true God** (as in Gen 1:1),
        
    - Or **divine beings** or **judges** (as in Psalm 82).
        
- Serpent’s ambiguity: is he offering godhood, divinity, or angelic insight?
    
- Either way, it tempts toward **equality with the Creator** — the same pride that led to Satan’s own fall (Isaiah 14:14).
    

**“Knowing good and evil” (יֹדְעֵי טוֹב וָרָע)**

- Hebrew _yada_ = to know intimately or experientially.
    
- God knows good and evil without evil **within Himself**.
    
- Humanity, by contrast, gains this knowledge **through rebellion**, bringing **death and corruption**.

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Liberal theology and mystical traditions often present this verse as **true insight**: that man’s eyes were opened and that becoming “like God” was a positive thing.
    
- Gnostic texts (e.g., _Apocryphon of John_) even treat the serpent as the liberator and YHWH as a deceiving demiurge — a complete **inversion of Scripture’s witness**.
    
- The clear context shows this “opening” is **post-sin awareness**, not divine upgrade.

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Anno Mundi 0**, final moment before the transgression. The serpent’s seduction ends with a vision of **self-sovereignty and forbidden enlightenment**.

---

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.”

**YLT:**  
“For God doth know that in the day of your eating of it — your eyes have been opened, and ye have been as God, knowing good and evil.”

**NIV:**  
“For God knows that when you eat from it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.”

_KJV and LXX preserve ambiguity with “gods”; NIV makes a theological choice for “God” — likely correct in context, but still interpretive. YLT blends both._

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

**Isaiah 14:14** — Lucifer’s prideful ambition: “I will be like the Most High.”

**Jubilees 3:22–25** — confirms that after the fall, Adam and Chavah recognized their nakedness, and Elohim declared they had gained **knowledge of good and evil**.

**1 Enoch 69:6–9** — lists fallen angels who imparted knowledge to mankind — mirrors this moment as the **origin of corrupted enlightenment**.
