### **GENESIS 3:16**

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**To the woman He said, “I will greatly multiply your sorrow and your conception — in pain you shall bring forth children. And your desire shall be for your husband, and he shall rule over you.”**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

אֶל־הָאִשָּׁה אָמַר  
הַרְבָּה אַרְבֶּה עִצְּבוֹנֵךְ וְהֵרֹנֵךְ  
בְּעֶצֶב תֵּלְדִי בָנִים  
וְאֶל־אִישֵׁךְ תְּשׁוּקָתֵךְ  
וְהוּא יִמְשָׁל־בָּךְ

---

#### Transliteration:

_El ha’ishah amar:  
Harbah arbeh itz’vonekh ve’heironekh,  
be’etzeb teledi vanim;  
ve’el ishekh teshukatek;  
ve’hu yimshol-bakh._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“To the woman he said, I will greatly multiply your pains and your groanings; in pain you shall bring forth children, and your submission shall be to your husband, and he shall rule over you.”

_LXX replaces “conception” (_heronaykh_) with “groanings” — possibly a reflection of oral tradition or differing manuscript lineage._

---

#### DSS (4QGen-Exoda):

Agrees fully with MT; includes both _itz’vonekh_ (sorrow) and _heironekh_ (conception). No indication that “groaning” is the better reading.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“I will greatly multiply…” (הַרְבָּה אַרְבֶּה)**

- Doubling of the verb = **intensification**. Literally: _“Multiplying, I will multiply…”_
    
- Echoes a judicial formula: **certainty and severity**.
    

**“Your sorrow and your conception…” (עִצְּבוֹנֵךְ וְהֵרֹנֵךְ)**

- _Itz’von_ = anguish, sorrow, grief — not merely physical pain.
    
- _Heiron_ = conception — emphasizes both **fertility** and the **cost of reproduction**.
    
- The woman is **not cursed**, but her **blessing is now burdened**.
    

**“In pain you shall bring forth children…”**

- _Be’etzeb teledi vanim_ — consistent across texts. Introduces **suffering into childbearing**, a process once likely intended to be joyful.
    

**“Your desire shall be for your husband…” (תְּשׁוּקָתֵךְ)**

- _Teshukah_ = longing, desire — used again in Gen 4:7 of sin's desire for Cain.
    
- This **may not be romantic**; it may indicate **yearning for position or affirmation**, or even dependence.
    

**“He shall rule over you…” (יִמְשָׁל־בָּךְ)**

- _Yimshol_ = dominate, rule, govern.
    
- This is **descriptive**, not prescriptive — it describes **fallen relational dynamics**, not God's design.
    
- A power imbalance is introduced **because of sin**, not by divine intention.

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Some religious traditions weaponize this verse to **mandate female subjugation**, misreading a judgment as a command.
    
- Rabbinic and Christian commentators often ignore the fact that **this is a consequence of sin**, not the original creation order (cf. Gen 1:27–28 — both male and female given dominion).
    
- The LXX’s replacement of “conception” with “groaning” dulls the **biological reality** embedded in the Hebrew.

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Anno Mundi 0**, following the serpent’s sentence. This verse records the **second judgment** of the fall — consequences for the woman, but **no curse language** is used.

---

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.”

**YLT:**  
“Unto the woman He said, ‘Multiplying I multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou dost bear children, and toward thy husband is thy desire, and he doth rule over thee.’”

**NIV:**  
“To the woman he said, ‘I will make your pains in childbearing very severe; with painful labor you will give birth to children. Your desire will be for your husband, and he will rule over you.’”

_NIV paraphrases heavily, especially “pains in childbearing” and removes “conception,” which is explicitly in the Hebrew._

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

**1 Timothy 2:13–15** — Paul connects this judgment to authority order in the church but emphasizes salvation through childbearing — linking back to _zar’ah_ in 3:15.

**Jubilees 3:31–33** — expands on this judgment, adding that Eve wept over her condition and that Adam mourned her sorrow.

**Ecclesiastes 1:13** — “It is a sore travail God hath given to the sons of men…” echoes post-fall labor.
