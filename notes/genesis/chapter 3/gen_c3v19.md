### **GENESIS 3:19**

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**By the sweat of your face you shall eat bread, until you return to the ground — for from it you were taken. For dust you are, and to dust you shall return.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

בְּזֵעַת אַפֶּיךָ תֹּאכַל לֶחֶם  
עַד שֻׁבְךָ אֶל־הָאֲדָמָה  
כִּי מִמֶּנָּה לֻקָּחְתָּ  
כִּי עָפָר אַתָּה  
וְאֶל־עָפָר תָּשׁוּב

---

#### Transliteration:

_B’ze’at appekha tokhal lekhem,  
ad shuvkha el ha’adamah,  
ki mimennah luqakhta —  
ki afar atah,  
ve’el afar tashuv._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“In the sweat of your face shall you eat your bread until you return to the earth, out of which you were taken: for earth you are, and to earth you shall return.”

_Nearly identical; LXX uses “earth” (γῆ) in place of “dust,” following the semantic field but softening the imagery._

---

#### DSS (4QGen-Exoda):

Aligns fully with MT. _Afar_ (dust) is present in both occurrences — no variant readings of note.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“By the sweat of your face…” (בְּזֵעַת אַפֶּיךָ)**

- _Ze’at_ = sweat; _appekha_ = your nose/face — a vivid image of exertion and physical effort.
    
- Labor now causes **strain and fatigue** — a marked departure from Edenic ease.
    

**“You shall eat bread…” (תֹּאכַל לֶחֶם)**

- _Lekhem_ = bread, but more broadly, _sustenance_ or _grain food_ — now a **product of toil**, not divine gift.
    
- The **ground resists**, and provision comes only through **human endurance**.
    

**“Until you return to the ground…”**

- _Shuv_ = return — implies **reversal of creation**, a going back to origin.
    
- Man is now **bound to mortality** — **death enters history** as consequence.
    

**“For dust you are…” (עָפָר אַתָּה)**

- _Afar_ = fine dust, ashes — not _soil_ but **pulverized earth**, emphasizing **fragility**.
    
- Reminds man of his origin — humble and transient.
    

**“To dust you shall return…”**

- Not symbolic — this is a **literal pronouncement of bodily death**.
    
- This statement ends the Edenic promise of **eternal life in the flesh** — it now must be redeemed through resurrection.

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Rabbinic tradition sometimes views death here as **spiritual only**, but the Hebrew text makes clear: this is **bodily decay**.
    
- Gnostic heresies invert this: seeing matter (dust) as evil, they interpret this as _liberation_ — but Genesis calls it a **loss**, not a gain.
    
- Some Catholic and Protestant interpretations read “return to dust” as purely **poetic** — but the ground’s curse (v.17–18) and this outcome form a **theological arc of corruption and redemption**.

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Anno Mundi 0**, conclusion of judgment. This marks the introduction of **death and decay into the human condition**.

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.”

**YLT:**  
“By the sweat of thy face thou dost eat bread till thy return unto the ground, for out of it thou hast been taken — for dust thou art, and unto dust thou turnest back.”

**NIV:**  
“By the sweat of your brow you will eat your food until you return to the ground, since from it you were taken; for dust you are and to dust you will return.”

_NIV’s “brow” is an interpretive gloss of _face_; “food” generalizes _bread_. KJV and YLT preserve the literal form._

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

**Ecclesiastes 12:7** — “The dust returns to the earth as it was, and the spirit returns to God who gave it.”

**1 Corinthians 15:47–49** — contrasts **earthly man of dust** with the **heavenly man**, Messiah — this verse becomes a key foundation for resurrection theology.

**Jubilees 4:29–30** — expands on Adam’s burial and the meaning of returning to dust — a theme echoed in ancient funeral liturgies.
