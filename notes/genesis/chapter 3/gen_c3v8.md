### **GENESIS 3:8**

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And they heard the voice of YHWH Elohim walking in the garden at the spirit of the day, and the man and his wife hid themselves from the face of YHWH Elohim among the trees of the garden.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וַיִּשְׁמְעוּ  
אֶת־קוֹל יְהוָה אֱלֹהִים  
מִתְהַלֵּךְ בַּגָּן  
לְרוּחַ הַיּוֹם  
וַיִּתְחַבֵּא הָאָדָם וְאִשְׁתּוֹ  
מִפְּנֵי יְהוָה אֱלֹהִים  
בְּתוֹךְ עֵץ הַגָּן

---

#### Transliteration:

_Vayyishme’u  
et-qol YHWH Elohim  
mithalekh ba’gan  
l’ruach ha’yom.  
Vayyitchabbe ha’adam ve’ishto  
mi’penei YHWH Elohim  
betoch etz ha’gan._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in the evening, and both Adam and his wife hid themselves from the face of the Lord God in the midst of the trees of the garden.”

_LXX interprets “ruach ha’yom” as “evening” — a possible idiomatic rendering._

---

#### DSS (4QGen-Exoda):

No textual deviation; confirms the phrasing _YHWH Elohim_ and _qol YHWH_ (voice of the LORD).

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“Heard the voice of YHWH Elohim walking” (קוֹל יְהוָה … מִתְהַלֵּךְ)**

- _Qol YHWH_ = “voice/sound of YHWH” — this may mean **audible speech**, or **a sonic manifestation** of divine presence (cf. Exod 19:19).
    
- _Mithalekh_ = walking repeatedly or habitually — **anthropomorphic language** denoting presence.
    
- This suggests **YHWH’s relational proximity** — not an abstract deity, but **present and personal**.
    

**“In the spirit of the day” (לְרוּחַ הַיּוֹם)**

- _Ruach_ = spirit, wind, breeze — _not_ necessarily “cool” or “evening.”
    
- Could imply **a specific appointed time** (cf. Dan 3:8), or a **divine visitation hour**.
    
- LXX “evening” is interpretive; Hebrew favors “spirit/breath of the day.”
    

**“Hid themselves… from the face of YHWH Elohim”**

- _Mipenei_ = “from the presence/face” — same word used in judgment contexts (cf. Jonah 1:3).
    
- First instance of **human separation** from God.
    
- Sin introduces **fear of His presence**, not intimacy.

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Many traditions allegorize this encounter — portraying it as figurative or symbolic.
    
- The narrative shows YHWH **physically manifesting** in the garden — not distant or abstract.
    
- The phrase “cool of the day” (common in KJV) weakens the Hebrew meaning and shifts attention away from **divine presence** to a weather condition.

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Anno Mundi 0**, moments after the fall — the first divine-human confrontation. Sin has already altered how man perceives God: **from comfort to fear**.

---

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden.”

**YLT:**  
“And they hear the voice of Jehovah God walking up and down in the garden at the breeze of the day, and the man and his wife hide themselves from the face of Jehovah God in the midst of the trees of the garden.”

**NIV:**  
“Then the man and his wife heard the sound of the Lord God as he was walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and they hid from the Lord God among the trees of the garden.”

_KJV and NIV favor “cool of the day,” obscuring _ruach_; YLT comes closer with “breeze.” All retain the structure of hearing → hiding._

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

**Exodus 33:11** — “YHWH spoke to Moses face to face” — echoes the relational intention seen in Eden.

**Revelation 6:16** — the wicked hide from “the face of Him who sits on the throne” — a reversal of Eden.

**Jubilees 3:28–30** — expands this scene with angelic reaction and divine judgment foreshadowing.
