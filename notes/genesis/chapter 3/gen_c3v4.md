### **GENESIS 3:4**

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And the serpent said to the woman, “You shall not surely die.”**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וַיֹּאמֶר הַנָּחָשׁ  
אֶל־הָאִשָּׁה  
לֹא מוֹת תְּמֻתוּן

---

#### Transliteration:

_Vayyomer ha’nachash  
el ha’ishah,  
lo mot temutun._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And the serpent said to the woman, Ye shall not surely die.”

_Identical structure to the Hebrew — a direct contradiction of Gen 2:17._

---

#### DSS (4QGen-Exoda):

No deviation from MT. The wording is preserved identically.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“You shall not surely die” (לֹא מוֹת תְּמֻתוּן)**

- _Mot tamut_ (מוֹת תָּמוּת) in Gen 2:17 = “dying you shall die” — emphatic, doubled verb indicating **absolute certainty**.
    
- _Lo mot temutun_ = “you will not surely die” — a **direct inversion** of God’s word.
    
- The serpent does not question, reinterpret, or misquote — he **flatly contradicts** Elohim.
    

**Structure and Tactic:**

- The serpent’s statement mimics the same **verb-doubling pattern** God used — but reverses it with _lo_ (no/not).
    
- First recorded **lie** in Scripture — and it concerns the **consequences of sin**.
    
- Theological hinge: Satan undermines **God’s justice** by denying judgment.

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Some liberal or mystical traditions reinterpret the serpent’s words as **truthful in a metaphorical sense** — claiming death was spiritual, not physical.
    
- But the **textual pattern is clear**: the serpent’s words **contradict God** and are followed by a **fall and a curse** — this is not enlightenment, it is **deception**.
    
- The popular re-framing of the serpent as a liberator (e.g., in Gnostic texts) is **diametrically opposed** to the biblical narrative and relies on misreading this moment.

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Anno Mundi 0**, mid-dialogue — the lie is planted. This is the **climactic turning point** of the temptation.

---

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die.”

**YLT:**  
“And the serpent saith unto the woman, ‘Dying, ye do not die,’”

**NIV:**  
“You will not certainly die,” the serpent said to the woman.

_All preserve the basic denial. YLT retains the doubled Hebrew form; NIV modernizes the construction but may lose the emphatic echo._

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

**John 8:44** — Yeshua identifies Satan as “a liar, and the father of it,” and notes he was a “murderer from the beginning” — a clear callback to this verse.

**Wisdom of Solomon 2:24** — “By the envy of the devil, death entered the world.”

**Jubilees 3:21** — also preserves the serpent’s lie and confirms Eve was deceived, not malicious.
