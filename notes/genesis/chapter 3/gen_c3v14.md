### **GENESIS 3:14**

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And YHWH Elohim said to the serpent: “Because you have done this, you are cursed above all the livestock and above every beast of the field. On your belly you shall go, and dust you shall eat all the days of your life.”**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וַיֹּאמֶר יְהוָה אֱלֹהִים אֶל־הַנָּחָשׁ  
כִּי עָשִׂיתָ זֹּאת  
אָרוּר אַתָּה מִכָּל־הַבְּהֵמָה  
וּמִכֹּל חַיַּת הַשָּׂדֶה  
עַל־גְּחֹנְךָ תֵלֵךְ  
וְעָפָר תֹּאכַל  
כֹּל יְמֵי חַיֶּיךָ

---

#### Transliteration:

_Vayomer YHWH Elohim el ha’nachash:  
Ki asita zot,  
arur attah mikol ha’behemah  
u’mikkol chayat ha’sadeh;  
al-gehon’kha telekh,  
ve’afar to’khal  
kol yemei chayekha._

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And the Lord God said to the serpent, Because you have done this, you are cursed above all cattle and all the beasts of the earth: on your breast and belly you shall go, and you shall eat earth all the days of your life.”

_Notable addition: LXX inserts “on your breast and belly” — a likely interpretive expansion._

---

#### DSS (4QGen-Exoda):

Fully supports MT phrasing; no variants in curse structure or anatomy reference. Dust-eating and belly locomotion are preserved.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“Because you have done this…”**

- God skips inquiry — unlike with Adam and Eve — and moves **directly to judgment**.
    
- This signals **irreversible guilt** with no offer of repentance.
    

**“Cursed above all livestock and every beast of the field”**

- _Arur attah mikol ha’behemah_ — this is the **first divine curse** in Scripture.
    
- The serpent is demoted from its prior position — **once upright?** — now beneath all creation.
    

**“On your belly you shall go…”**

- Implies a transformation — ancient traditions (and some Midrash) suggest the serpent originally had **legs or wings**.
    
- The curse **symbolically and physically degrades** the creature.
    

**“Dust you shall eat…”**

- Figurative of **humiliation and futility** (cf. Isa 65:25).
    
- Not a biological diet, but a **metaphor for defeat** and continual degradation.
    

**Spiritual layer:**

- Many early Hebrew and Christian commentators see the serpent here as **Satan-possessed** or a **dual figure** — both animal and spiritual deceiver.
    
- This curse addresses **both dimensions**: physical creature and unseen rebel.

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Some modern theology reduces this verse to **natural zoology**, ignoring the **spiritual dimension**.
    
- Rabbinic and Catholic traditions occasionally allegorize the curse, downplaying the serpent as a literal being and instead treating it purely symbolically.
    
- Gnostic texts invert this moment — falsely casting the serpent as liberator rather than judged rebel.

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Anno Mundi 0**, immediate aftermath of the fall. This is the **first judicial pronouncement** from God upon a created being.

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And the Lord God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life.”

**YLT:**  
“And Jehovah God saith unto the serpent, ‘Because thou hast done this, cursed art thou above all the cattle, and above every beast of the field: on thy belly dost thou go, and dust thou dost eat, all days of thy life;’”

**NIV:**  
“So the Lord God said to the serpent, ‘Because you have done this, cursed are you above all livestock and all wild animals! You will crawl on your belly and you will eat dust all the days of your life.’”

_All three preserve the judgment, though KJV and YLT stay truer to the original phrasing. NIV simplifies tone and omits nuance like “beast of the field.”_

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

**Isaiah 65:25** — “Dust shall be the serpent’s food.” Echoes this Edenic curse even in the Messianic age.

**Revelation 12:9** — identifies “that ancient serpent” as “the Devil and Satan,” tying this verse to spiritual rebellion.

**Jubilees 3:23–28** — also narrates the curse on the serpent and adds context about its role and punishment among the animals.
