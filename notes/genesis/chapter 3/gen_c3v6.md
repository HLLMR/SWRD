וַתֵּרֶא הָאִשָּׁה  
כִּי טוֹב הָעֵץ לְמַאֲכָל  
וְכִי תַאֲוָה הוּא לָעֵינַיִם  
וְנֶחְמָד הָעֵץ לְהַשְׂכִּיל  
וַתִּקַּח מִפִּרְיוֹ וַתֹּאכַל  
וַתִּתֵּן גַּם לְאִישָׁהּ עִמָּהּ  
וַיֹּאכַל

_Vatteire ha’ishah  
ki tov ha’etz le’ma’akhal,  
ve’khi ta’avah hu la’einayim,  
ve’nechmad ha’etz le’haskil,  
va’tikach mipiryo va’tokhal,

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“Saw that the tree was good for food…”**

- Eve is evaluating the tree through **natural senses and personal desire** rather than divine command.
    
- This threefold evaluation mirrors **1 John 2:16**:
    
    - _Lust of the flesh_ (good for food),
        
    - _Lust of the eyes_ (pleasant to the eyes),
        
    - _Pride of life_ (desired to make one wise).
        

**“To make one wise” (לְהַשְׂכִּיל)**

- _Le’haskil_ = to give insight, prudence, or intelligence.
    
- Root word often used for **spiritual discernment** — the desire here is **spiritual autonomy**.
    

**“She took… and ate… gave also to her husband with her”**

- No hesitation — **seven quick actions** drive the fall:
    
    1. Saw
        
    2. Desired
        
    3. Took
        
    4. Ate
        
    5. Gave
        
    6. Was with her
        
    7. Ate (he also)
        
- Adam was **with her** — he is not deceived (cf. 1 Tim 2:14), but **willingly joins her**.
    
- Hebrew phrasing emphasizes **shared agency** — _not a one-sided fall_.
    

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Some traditions exaggerate Eve’s fault while downplaying Adam’s — yet Scripture repeatedly **holds Adam responsible** (Rom 5:12).
    
- Rabbinic writings sometimes vilify Eve; Gnostic texts idolize her — both miss the equal **moral failure and shared consequence**.
    
- The common idea that Adam was absent is refuted by _“with her”_ in the text.

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Anno Mundi 0**, the decisive moment — spiritual death enters, though physical death is delayed. This action concludes the temptation sequence and initiates judgment.

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.”

**YLT:**  
“And the woman seeth that the tree is good for food, and that it is pleasant to the eyes, and the tree is desirable to make one wise, and she taketh of its fruit and eateth, and giveth also to her husband with her, and he doth eat.”

**NIV:**  
“When the woman saw that the fruit of the tree was good for food and pleasing to the eye, and also desirable for gaining wisdom, she took some and ate it. She also gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate it.”

_NIV is the most interpretive; YLT and KJV preserve the Hebrew cadence better._

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

**Jubilees 3:21–26** — explicitly recounts the act, Eve’s shame, and the heavenly reaction.

**1 Timothy 2:14** — Paul affirms Eve was deceived, Adam was not — deepens the meaning of his willful disobedience.

**Romans 5:12–19** — central theological reflection on this verse: through one man’s sin, death passed to all men.
