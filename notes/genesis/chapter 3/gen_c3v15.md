### **GENESIS 3:15**

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your seed and her seed. He shall crush your head, and you shall strike his heel.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וְאֵיבָה אָשִׁית בֵּינְךָ וּבֵין הָאִשָּׁה  
וּבֵין זַרְעֲךָ וּבֵין זַרְעָהּ  
הוּא יְשׁוּפְךָ רֹאשׁ  
וְאַתָּה תְּשׁוּפֶנּוּ עָקֵב

---

#### Transliteration:

_Ve’eyvah ashit beynkha u’veyn ha’ishah,  
u’veyn zar’akha u’veyn zar’ah;  
hu yeshufkha rosh,  
ve’attah teshufennu akev._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your seed and her seed: he shall watch against your head, and you shall watch against his heel.”

_LXX uses “watch against” (τηρήσει / terēsei), softening the violent imagery found in MT._

---

#### DSS (4QGen-Exoda):

Aligns with MT in all key phrases. No alterations in _eyvah_ (enmity), _zar’ah_ (her seed), or _yeshuf_ (crush/bruise). Pronouns are masculine singular — **“he”** not “they.”

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“Enmity between you and the woman…”**

- _Eyvah_ = hostility, animosity, deep-seated conflict.
    
- This is not mere rivalry — it signifies **perpetual spiritual war**.
    

**“Between your seed and her seed…”**

- Unusual: **“her seed”** — in Hebrew, _zera_ is normally **masculine** and passed through the father.
    
- This singular feminine reference is viewed by many as a **Messianic prophecy**: a **male born of a woman**, apart from male seed (virgin birth).
    

**“He shall crush your head…” (יְשׁוּפְךָ רֹאשׁ)**

- _Yeshufkha rosh_ — _crush, bruise, strike_ your head. Head = **fatal blow**.
    
- Verb implies **decisive, final wound**.
    

**“You shall strike his heel…” (תְּשׁוּפֶנּוּ עָקֵב)**

- _Akev_ = heel, a **lesser wound**, but still painful.
    
- The serpent can wound the **Messianic seed**, but not destroy Him.
    

This is the **protoevangelion** — the first prophecy of **Messianic redemption**:

> A deliverer will rise from the woman to destroy the serpent, though He Himself will be wounded in the process.

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- **Vatican Vulgate** changes _he_ to **“she shall crush thy head”**, later influencing **Marian dogma** and iconography.
    
- Some modern critical translations obscure the **personal masculine pronoun**, reducing it to “they” or “it,” diminishing the **Messianic specificity**.
    
- Allegorical interpretations blur the real war between spiritual forces and the human line that culminates in Messiah.

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Anno Mundi 0** — this pronouncement occurs immediately after the fall. It begins the **prophetic thread of redemption** that will unfold throughout Scripture.

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.”

**YLT:**  
“And enmity I put between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; he doth bruise thee — the head, and thou dost bruise him — the heel.”

**NIV:**  
“And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring and hers; he will crush your head, and you will strike his heel.”

_KJV says “it” instead of “he” — based on earlier English rendering. YLT and NIV rightly preserve the **masculine singular** subject._

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

**Isaiah 7:14** — “A virgin shall conceive and bear a son…” connects to the idea of _her seed_.

**Galatians 4:4** — “When the fullness of time had come, God sent forth His Son, born of a woman…”

**Revelation 12:17** — the dragon wars against the **seed of the woman**, who keep God’s commandments and hold to the testimony of Yeshua.

**Jubilees 4:30** — frames the serpent’s enmity as ongoing spiritual warfare among the sons of men, especially between the righteous and the offspring of wickedness.
