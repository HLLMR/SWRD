### **GENESIS 3:18**

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And thorns and thistles it shall bring forth for you; and you shall eat the herb of the field.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וְקוֹץ וְדַרְדַּר תַּצְמִיחַ לָךְ  
וְאָכַלְתָּ אֶת־עֵשֶׂב הַשָּׂדֶה

---

#### Transliteration:

_V’qotz ve’dardar tatzmiach lakh,  
ve’akhalta et-esev ha’sadeh._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“Thorns and thistles shall it bring forth to thee, and thou shalt eat the herb of the field.”

_Virtually identical to MT. LXX confirms agrarian consequences and symbolic vegetation._

---

#### DSS (4QGen-Exoda):

No significant variant; matches MT in structure and vocabulary. _Qotz_ and _dardar_ appear clearly as botanical thorns.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“Thorns and thistles…” (קוֹץ וְדַרְדַּר)**

- _Qotz_ = thorn; _dardar_ = thistle or burr-weed — the language conveys **hostile vegetation**, growing uninvited.
    
- These are the **first unnatural plant forms** introduced post-fall.
    
- Symbolize resistance, futility, and **opposition to man’s efforts**.
    

**“It shall bring forth for you…”**

- Not _you_ will grow it — **the ground rebels**, producing what you did not plant.
    
- Curse affects **man's dominion** over creation: **nature no longer submits** without toil.
    

**“You shall eat the herb of the field…”**

- _Esev ha’sadeh_ = field-plant or wild herb — different from the **tree fruit of Eden**.
    
- Man now **forages and farms** rather than **freely receives**.
    
- This signals a **lowered provision** and **transition to subsistence survival**.

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Some traditions spiritualize “thorns” without acknowledging the **literal botanical change** in the Earth’s condition.
    
- Gnostic misreadings claim the material world was always flawed — Genesis denies this: the ground was **“very good”**, but became cursed **because of sin**.
    
- Catholic and Protestant liturgies often omit this verse from public reading, minimizing the cost of sin on **the natural order**.

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Anno Mundi 0**, continuing consequence of Adam’s fall. This verse completes the picture of **corrupted agriculture and environment**.

---

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field.”

**YLT:**  
“And thorn and bramble it doth bring forth to thee, and thou hast eaten the herb of the field;”

**NIV:**  
“It will produce thorns and thistles for you, and you will eat the plants of the field.”

_NIV’s “plants” generalizes “herb” — KJV and YLT preserve the specific agrarian sense._

---

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

**Matthew 13:7, 22** — thorns choke the seed in Yeshua’s parable — allusion to the **curse of fruitless toil**.

**Hebrews 6:8** — “That which bears thorns and thistles is rejected…” — again echoes the Eden curse as a type of unproductive ground.

**Jubilees 3:27–30** — elaborates on Adam’s labor and the transformed soil, referencing the difficulty in producing food post-exile.
