### **GENESIS 3:12**

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And the man said, “The woman whom You gave to be with me — she gave me from the tree, and I ate.”**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וַיֹּאמֶר הָאָדָם  
הָאִשָּׁה אֲשֶׁר נָתַתָּה עִמָּדִי  
הִיא נָתְנָה־לִּי מִן־הָעֵץ  
וָאֹכֵל

---

#### Transliteration:

_Vayomer ha’adam,  
ha’ishah asher natattah imadi,  
hi natnah-li min ha’etz,  
va’okhel._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And Adam said, The woman whom you gave to be with me — she gave me of the tree, and I ate.”

_LXX tracks MT very closely. The structure and blame-shift are preserved in full._

---

#### DSS (4QGen-Exoda):

No deviation from MT. Syntax and pronouns match Masoretic wording, including emphatic _she gave_ (הִיא נָתְנָה).

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“The woman whom You gave…”**

- Adam shifts blame to **both the woman and indirectly to YHWH**.
    
- The phrase _asher natattah imadi_ = _whom You gave to be with me_ — Adam implies **God’s provision is the source of the problem**.
    
- This is not repentance, it’s **deflection**.
    

**“She gave me from the tree…”**

- Adam admits eating, but **minimizes personal responsibility**.
    
- The emphasis is on **what she did**, not on his own failure to obey.
    

**“And I ate.”**

- Last phrase is clipped — _va’okhel_ — admission without elaboration.
    
- It’s a **reluctant confession**, tacked on after shifting blame.
    

This verse is the **template for fallen human behavior**:

> **Minimize. Deflect. Justify. Blame. Then admit.**

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Institutional theology often over-emphasizes Eve’s culpability, but Adam here is **responsible for his own choice** and was **commanded directly** in Gen 2:17 before Eve was even created.
    
- Adam’s blame-shifting subtly indicts **God Himself** — a detail that tends to be glossed over in sermonized retellings.

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Anno Mundi 0**, still within the immediate aftermath of the fall. This is Adam’s only recorded speech until post-Eden.

---

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.”

**YLT:**  
“And the man saith, ‘The woman whom Thou didst place with me — she hath given to me of the tree — and I do eat.’”

**NIV:**  
“The man said, ‘The woman you put here with me — she gave me some fruit from the tree, and I ate it.’”

_All translations preserve the shift of blame. NIV adds “fruit” (not in MT) for clarity, but the original Hebrew simply says “from the tree.”_

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

**Proverbs 19:3** — “A man’s own folly ruins his life, yet his heart rages against the LORD.”

> Adam’s instinct to blame God mirrors this proverb’s warning.

**Jubilees 3:35–36** — further details this conversation, noting angelic witnesses and writing of judgments.

**Romans 5:12–14** — credits the entrance of sin to _Adam_, not Eve — highlighting his primary accountability despite the blame attempt.
