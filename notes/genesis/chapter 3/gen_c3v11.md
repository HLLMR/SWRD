### **GENESIS 3:11**

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And He said, “Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree of which I commanded you not to eat?”**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וַיֹּאמֶר  
מִי הִגִּיד לְךָ כִּי עֵירֹם אָתָּה  
הֲמִן־הָעֵץ אֲשֶׁר צִוִּיתִיךָ  
לְבִלְתִּי אֲכָל מִמֶּנּוּ  
אָכָלְתָּ

---

#### Transliteration:

_Vayomer,  
mi higgid lekha ki eirom atah?  
Ha-min ha’etz asher tzivvitikha  
levilti akhol mimennu — akhalta?_

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And he said to him, Who told you that you were naked, unless you have eaten of the tree concerning which I charged you not to eat of this?”

_LXX uses a slightly softer construction (“unless you have…”) but preserves the intent._

---

#### DSS (4QGen-Exoda):

Fully aligns with MT. No variations in interrogative phrasing or divine emphasis.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“Who told you that you were naked?”**

- YHWH’s question exposes the **moral awakening** tied to disobedience.
    
- This implies that **awareness of nakedness** is unnatural — it came from a **source outside of divine design**.
    

**“Have you eaten from the tree…?”**

- The structure _ha-min ha’etz_ is interrogative, yet accusatory — God already knows.
    
- This is a **judicial question**: giving Adam the chance to confess.
    
- The phrase “of which I commanded you not to eat” underscores **divine authority** and the **clear command** broken (cf. Gen 2:17).
    

**Progression of divine inquiry:**

1. **Where are you?** (v.9) — spiritual position
    
2. **Who told you?** (v.11a) — moral corruption source
    
3. **Have you eaten?** (v.11b) — direct confrontation with sin
    

This sequence models **divine justice tempered by mercy** — giving the sinner opportunity to come clean before judgment.

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Some traditions soften the accountability here — focusing only on “shame” rather than **willful rebellion**.
    
- Gnostic reinterpretations portray the eating of the fruit as **liberation** — but the divine question frames it as **transgression**.
    
- The clarity of the command and the sequence of questions **undermines free-form reinterpretations** of Eden as metaphor.

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Anno Mundi 0**, still the same encounter — this is the divine courtroom moment, where Elohim **interrogates the offender**, offering opportunity for admission before sentence.

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?”

**YLT:**  
“And He saith, ‘Who hath declared to thee that thou art naked? Of the tree of which I have commanded thee not to eat, hast thou eaten?’”

**NIV:**  
“And he said, ‘Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree that I commanded you not to eat from?’”

_All versions preserve the charge and tone. YLT is slightly stiffer; NIV and KJV maintain clarity. The interrogative form is well preserved in each._

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

**Romans 3:19–20** — “Every mouth may be stopped… for by the law is the knowledge of sin.”  
The law (command) brings accountability — exactly as we see here.

**Jubilees 3:34–35** — depicts this question and the beginning of Adam’s answer in a similarly judicial tone.

**1 John 1:9** — _“If we confess our sins…”_ — divine judgment always allows for confession first.
