### **GENESIS 3:3**

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**“But from the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden — Elohim has said, ‘You shall not eat of it, and you shall not touch it, lest you die.’”**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וּמִפְּרִי הָעֵץ  
אֲשֶׁר בְּתוֹךְ הַגָּן  
אָמַר אֱלֹהִים לֹא תֹאכְלוּ מִמֶּנּוּ  
וְלֹא תִגְּעוּ בּוֹ פֶּן־תְּמֻתוּן

#### Transliteration:

_U’mip’ri ha’etz  
asher b’tokh ha’gan,  
amar Elohim, lo tokhlu mimennu,  
ve’lo tig’u vo, pen-temutun._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“But of the fruit of the tree which is in the middle of the garden, God said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.”

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“The tree in the midst of the garden” (הָעֵץ אֲשֶׁר בְּתוֹךְ הַגָּן)**

- Identifies the _Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil_ from Gen 2:9, though unnamed here.
    
- “In the midst” = _b’tokh_ — central, prominent.
    

**“You shall not eat of it, and you shall not touch it”**

- The command **not to eat** is accurate, but the addition **“nor touch”** is **not found in God’s original words** (Gen 2:17).
    
- This addition introduces a **legalistic boundary**, possibly:
    
    - Chavah’s own elaboration for safety,
        
    - Adam’s misrepresentation in relaying the command,
        
    - Or early evidence of how **religious prohibition can add to God’s word**.
        

**“Lest you die” (פֶּן־תְּמֻתוּן)**

- _Pen-temutun_ = “lest you die” or “otherwise you will die.”
    
- Softer than God’s original **“dying you shall die”** (_mot tamut_) — which was emphatic and certain.
    
- Her phrasing introduces **uncertainty** where God had declared **certainty**.

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Many traditional commentaries **ignore or excuse** the addition of “touch” — yet this is the first instance of **adding to the Word of God**, a key theme in later Scripture (Deut 4:2, Prov 30:6).
    
- The subtle weakening of God’s threat (“lest you die”) is often underemphasized.
    
- Some traditions wrongly treat Chavah’s addition as a lie, when it's more likely a **well-meaning exaggeration** — illustrating how even small distortions can be exploited.

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Anno Mundi 0**, continuing within the temptation scene — this verse represents the second move in the dialogue: partial truth, slight overreach, softened warning.

---

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.”

**YLT:**  
“But of the fruit of the tree which [is] in the midst of the garden — God hath said, Ye do not eat of it, nor touch it, lest ye die.’”

**NIV:**  
“But God did say, ‘You must not eat fruit from the tree that is in the middle of the garden, and you must not touch it, or you will die.’”

_All translations reflect the added “touch” clause and the softened tone — only the Hebrew context shows how it diverges from the original._

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

**Jubilees 3:20** — notes that the woman approached the tree and was deceived — implying a visual and sensory temptation, possibly linked to her expanded restriction.

**Revelation 22:18–19** — later Scripture condemns **adding to or taking from** the Word — this may be the earliest proto-example of how that process begins.
