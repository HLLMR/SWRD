### **GENESIS 3:7**

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And the eyes of both of them were opened, and they knew that they were naked. And they sewed fig leaves together and made for themselves coverings.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וַתִּפָּקַחְנָה עֵינֵי שְׁנֵיהֶם  
וַיֵּדְעוּ כִּי עֵירֻמִּם הֵם  
וַיִּתְפְּרוּ עֲלֵה תְאֵנָה  
וַיַּעֲשׂוּ לָהֶם חֲגֹרֹת

---

#### Transliteration:

_Vattipakachnah einei sheneihem,  
vayedu ki erummim hem.  
Vayyitperu alei te’enah,  
vayya’asu lahem chagorot._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And the eyes of both of them were opened, and they perceived that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.”

_LXX mirrors the Hebrew closely, translating “coverings” as “aprons.”_

#### DSS (4QGen-Exoda):

No notable variation from the Masoretic reading.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“The eyes of both were opened” (וַתִּפָּקַחְנָה עֵינֵי שְׁנֵיהֶם)**

- This fulfills the serpent’s **partial truth** — their eyes were opened, but not unto divine wisdom; rather, to **shame and vulnerability**.
    
- “Opened” implies spiritual awakening, but the **fruit of disobedience** brings guilt, not godlikeness.
    

**“They knew they were naked” (וַיֵּדְעוּ כִּי עֵירֻמִּם הֵם)**

- _Yada_ = to know experientially.
    
- _Erummim_ = naked, exposed — this contrasts Gen 2:25, where they were “naked and unashamed.”
    
- Now, the knowledge of good and evil includes the **awareness of moral failure**.
    

**“Sewed fig leaves… coverings” (עֲלֵה תְאֵנָה … חֲגֹרֹת)**

- First human-made solution to sin = **covering up** rather than confessing.
    
- _Chagorot_ = belts, aprons — minimal garments, insufficient in later divine standards (cf. Gen 3:21).
    
- Fig leaves suggest **immediacy**, not durability.

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Some mystical and Gnostic traditions reinterpret this “opening of eyes” as **liberation**, aligning with modern progressive theologies.
    
- The text itself denies this — their response is **hiding**, not empowerment.
    
- The institutional church often reads this as merely a **loss of innocence**, when it is actually the **birth of guilt, fear, and separation**.

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Anno Mundi 0**, immediately post-fall — the first direct internal consequence of sin manifests: **shame, fear, and human effort to self-justify**.

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.”

**YLT:**  
“And the eyes of them both are opened, and they know that they [are] naked, and they sew fig-leaves, and make to themselves girdles.”

**NIV:**  
“Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they realized they were naked; so they sewed fig leaves together and made coverings for themselves.”

_NIV leans interpretive with “realized”; KJV/YLT preserve the verb “knew.” “Aprons/girdles/coverings” all reflect the Hebrew _chagorot_ — minimal waist garments._

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

**Jubilees 3:27–28** — explains their awareness and shame and records that fig leaves were specifically chosen.

**Revelation 3:17–18** — echoes Eden: “you are naked… buy from Me white garments to clothe yourself” — contrasting self-righteous coverings with divine provision.

**Isaiah 64:6** — “all our righteousness is as filthy rags” — humanity’s efforts to cover sin are inadequate.
