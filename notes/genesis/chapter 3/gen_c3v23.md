### **GENESIS 3:23**

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**Therefore YHWH Elohim sent him out from the Garden of Eden, to work the ground from which he was taken.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וַיְשַׁלְּחֵהוּ יְהוָה אֱלֹהִים  
מִגַּן־עֵדֶן  
לַעֲבֹד אֶת־הָאֲדָמָה  
אֲשֶׁר לֻקַּח מִשָּׁם

---

#### Transliteration:

_Vay’shallechehu YHWH Elohim  
mi’gan-ʿEden,  
laʿavod et ha’adamah  
asher luqqach misham._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“So the Lord God sent him forth out of the garden of pleasure to cultivate the ground out of which he was taken.”

_“Garden of pleasure” reflects Eden’s root meaning; otherwise, structure aligns with MT._

---

#### DSS (4QGen-Exoda):

Matches MT. No deviation from key terms: _gan-ʿEden_, _adamah_, _shalach_.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“YHWH Elohim sent him out” (וַיְשַׁלְּחֵהוּ)**

- _Vay’shallechehu_ = “He drove out / expelled him” — a **firm but not violent** action.
    
- This was **not voluntary exile** — but also not annihilation. A **protective judgment**.
    

**“From the Garden of Eden” (מִגַּן־עֵדֶן)**

- Reaffirms the **location is real**, not metaphorical.
    
- Eden is a **sacred, guarded space** — now lost to mankind until restoration.
    

**“To work the ground from which he was taken”**

- _Ha’adamah_ — not the same as _Eretz_ (land) — it refers to **soil** or **ground**.
    
- Echoes **Genesis 2:7** — man’s origin was dust; now, he must **labor over it**, not dwell above it.
    
- There’s a **poetic justice**: Adam is expelled from a garden he did not plant, to toil over ground that now **resists him**.

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Many translations obscure the **legal weight** of “sent out” — but this is a **covenant-breaking expulsion**.
    
- Catholic allegorists spiritualize Eden too heavily, detaching it from **real geography and consequence**.
    
- Modern theology often skips over the **land-to-dust cycle**, diminishing the Edenic fall’s **physical implications**.

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Anno Mundi 0**, culmination of the judgment. Marks the **official exile** — the moment the **post-Eden era begins**.

---

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“Therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.”

**YLT:**  
“Jehovah God sendeth him forth from the garden of Eden to serve the ground from which he hath been taken;”

**NIV:**  
“So the Lord God banished him from the Garden of Eden to work the ground from which he had been taken.”

_NIV’s “banished” adds emotional force — perhaps accurate in tone, but not strictly literal. “Serve the ground” (YLT) is the closest to the Hebrew nuance._

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

**Jubilees 3:20–23** — narrates the angelic lamentation and the ceremonial removal of Adam and Ḥavvah from the Garden.

**2 Esdras 7:10–12** — speaks of paradise now hidden, awaiting the righteous.

**Revelation 2:7** — “To him who overcomes, I will grant to eat of the tree of life, which is in the paradise of God” — ties directly back to the lost Eden.
