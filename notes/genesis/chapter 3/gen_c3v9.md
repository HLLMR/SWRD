### **GENESIS 3:9**

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And YHWH Elohim called to the man, and said to him, “Where are you?”**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וַיִּקְרָא יְהוָה אֱלֹהִים  
אֶל־הָאָדָם  
וַיֹּאמֶר לוֹ  
אַיֶּכָּה

---

#### Transliteration:

_Vayyiqra YHWH Elohim  
el ha’adam,  
vayomer lo,  
ayekah._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And the Lord God called Adam and said to him, Where art thou?”

_Minor difference: LXX uses the name “Adam” rather than “the man,” which is consistent with prior context but slightly more personal._

---

#### DSS (4QGen-Exoda):

Fully aligns with MT, including the divine Name and the singular second-person address.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“And YHWH Elohim called to the man…”**

- This is the **first recorded instance of God calling man** after sin.
    
- The call is **not accusatory**, but **relational** — an invitation to respond.
    
- Despite man’s rebellion, **YHWH initiates the encounter** — a pattern that echoes throughout Scripture.
    

**“Where are you?” (אַיֶּכָּה – ayekah)**

- A single, piercing word — a divine **searchlight** into man’s condition.
    
- Not a request for geographic location — Elohim is omniscient — but a **diagnostic question**:
    
    - _“Why are you hiding?”_
        
    - _“Where are you spiritually?”_
        
- This is a **covenantal call** back to accountability, a prelude to confrontation, yet saturated with mercy.

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Traditional interpretations often downplay the depth of this question.
    
- The church has occasionally painted this moment as one of **pure wrath**, but the text emphasizes **relational pursuit** before judgment.
    
- Some mystical traditions invert the meaning — suggesting God’s lack of omniscience — but this is clearly **rhetorical** and relational.

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Anno Mundi 0**, same event frame as Gen 3:8. This is the **first recorded divine-human dialogue post-fall**, marking a tragic new phase in redemptive history.

---

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And the Lord God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where art thou?”

**YLT:**  
“And Jehovah God calleth unto the man, and saith to him, ‘Where [art] thou?’”

**NIV:**  
“But the Lord God called to the man, ‘Where are you?’”

_All three maintain the key structure. KJV/LXX use “Adam,” while MT and NIV prefer “the man” — both are contextually accurate._

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

**Luke 19:10** — “For the Son of Man came to seek and to save that which was lost.” Direct echo of Edenic pursuit.

**Jubilees 3:31** — affirms the voice of God called to Adam after he had hidden, reinforcing the MT timeline and tone.

**Psalm 139:7–12** — “Where shall I flee from Your presence?” — theological expansion of this moment.
