### **GENESIS 3:22**

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**Then YHWH Elohim said, “Behold, the man has become like one of Us, to know good and evil. And now, lest he stretch out his hand and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live forever…”**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וַיֹּאמֶר יְהוָה אֱלֹהִים  
הֵן הָאָדָם הָיָה כְּאַחַד מִמֶּנּוּ  
לָדַעַת טוֹב וָרָע  
וְעַתָּה פֶּן־יִשְׁלַח יָדוֹ  
וְלָקַח גַּם מֵעֵץ הַחַיִּים  
וְאָכַל וָחַי לְעֹלָם

---

#### Transliteration:

_Vayomer YHWH Elohim:  
hen ha’adam hayah k’echad mimennu,  
lada’at tov va’ra.  
Ve’attah pen yishlach yado  
vela’kach gam me’etz hachayyim,  
ve’akhal va’chai l’olam._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And the Lord God said, Behold, Adam is become as one of Us, to know good and evil: and now, lest at any time he stretch forth his hand, and take of the tree of life, and eat, and so shall live forever…”

_LXX aligns closely with MT. The ellipsis at the end is carried forward in Greek — the sentence is left unfinished._

---

#### DSS (4QGen-Exoda):

No major variation from MT. The divine plural _mimmennu_ (“of Us”) and the clause _pen yishlach yado_ (“lest he stretch out his hand”) are fully preserved.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“Behold, the man has become like one of Us…” (הֵן הָאָדָם הָיָה כְּאַחַד מִמֶּנּוּ)**

- _Hen_ = behold, look! Marks **divine alarm or emphasis**.
    
- The phrase “like one of Us” reaffirms a **plurality within the divine** — earlier hinted at in Gen 1:26.
    
    - Strong support for **complex unity** (cf. _echad_ use).
        
    - Dismantles strict monotheist interpretations that exclude **Divine Council** or **Trinitarian complexity**.
        
- _Hayah_ = “has become” — Adam did not begin this way.
    

**“To know good and evil” (לָדַעַת טוֹב וָרָע)**

- _Lada’at_ = to discern or experience.
    
- Knowledge here is **experiential and moral**, not simply intellectual.
    
- Implies an internal shift — the man now acts as his **own moral authority**, bypassing divine command.
    

**“Lest he stretch out his hand…” (פֶּן־יִשְׁלַח יָדוֹ)**

- _Pen_ = lest, to prevent — divine concern about **potential defiance**.
    
- The act of _stretching out the hand_ = reaching toward **autonomy**, **immortality on man’s own terms**.
    

**“Tree of life… and live forever” (עֵץ הַחַיִּים… וָחַי לְעֹלָם)**

- This is the **second time** the Tree of Life is mentioned (first in 2:9), but now its **function** is stated — **eternal life**.
    
- Crucial: Eternal life at this point would **lock in a fallen state** — necessitating **banishment** to allow for redemption.
    
- The sentence ends without closure — a dramatic ellipsis that expresses the **urgency of divine action** to prevent a tragic permanence.

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Liberal theology often removes divine plurality here, reducing “Us” to **editorial error** or **royal we** — inconsistent with Hebraic grammar and theology.
    
- Many systems overlook the **tree of life’s power**, treating it as a literary device — yet it reappears **literally in Revelation 22**, affirming continuity.
    
- Rome’s doctrine of **natural immortality of the soul** is challenged here — man was **mortal**, and **only becomes immortal through access to the tree** (or resurrection).

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Anno Mundi 0**, immediate prelude to banishment. Time frame is tight — these words follow God's act of covering and precede the cherubim placement.

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And the Lord God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever—”

**YLT:**  
“And Jehovah God saith, ‘Lo, the man was as one of Us, as to the knowledge of good and evil; and now, lest he send forth his hand, and have taken also of the tree of life, and eaten, and lived to the age,’—”

**NIV:**  
“And the Lord God said, ‘The man has now become like one of Us, knowing good and evil. He must not be allowed to reach out his hand and take also from the tree of life and eat, and live forever.’”

_NIV adds a clause not in the Hebrew: “He must not be allowed…” — interpretive, not literal._

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

**Revelation 22:2, 14** — Tree of Life returns in the New Jerusalem, accessible to the redeemed — NOT the fallen.

**Jubilees 3:17–20** — echoes this event and emphasizes the **angelic fear** of man acquiring immortality in sin.

**1 Enoch 25** — describes the Tree of Life as **holy, fragrant, and reserved for the righteous**, rooted near the throne of Elohim.
