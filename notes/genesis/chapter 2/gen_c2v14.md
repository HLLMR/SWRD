### **GENESIS 2:14**

_Traditional Genesis 2:17_

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**But from the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil, you shall not eat from it — for in the day that you eat from it, you will surely die.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וּמֵעֵץ הַדַּעַת טוֹב וָרָע  
לֹא תֹאכַל מִמֶּנּוּ  
כִּי בְּיוֹם אֲכָלְךָ מִמֶּנּוּ  
מוֹת תָּמוּת

---

#### Transliteration:

_U-me’etz ha-da’at tov va-ra,  
lo tokhal mimennu;  
ki b’yom akholkha mimennu,  
mot tamut._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil — of it ye shall not eat; for in the day that ye eat of it, ye shall surely die.”

_The Greek preserves the Hebrew idiomatic death formula — “dying you shall die.”_

---

#### DSS (4QGen-Exoda):

Text matches MT exactly; confirms the presence of the **emphatic death phrase** (_mot tamut_), as well as the name of the tree.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil” (עֵץ הַדַּעַת טוֹב וָרָע)**

- _Da’at_ = experiential knowledge, not just intellectual.
    
- _Tov va-ra_ = a Hebrew merism — **the full spectrum of moral distinction**.
    
- The tree represents **autonomous moral authority** — the right to define good and evil, rather than receive it from Elohim.
    

**“You shall not eat” (לֹא תֹאכַל מִמֶּנּוּ)**

- Command structure is direct and absolute — **prohibition with a consequence**.
    

**“In the day you eat from it, dying you shall die” (מוֹת תָּמוּת)**

- Idiomatic expression meaning **certain and irreversible death** — not necessarily immediate, but guaranteed.
    
- The phrase appears again in Genesis 20:7 and 1 Kings 2:37 — a **legal death sentence** formula.
    

This is the first negative command in Scripture — and its severity underscores the **stakes of covenant disobedience**.

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Some traditions spiritualize the death as merely “separation from God,” but the Hebrew makes it plain: **death enters as a judicial certainty**.
    
- Modern liberal theology often mocks the idea of a tree granting moral knowledge — but the real issue is **obedience and submission** vs **autonomy**.
    
- The tree is sometimes mischaracterized as evil itself — but the tree is good; it’s the **disobedience** that is deadly.

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Anno Mundi 0**, Day 6 — immediately following the commission of Adam and preceding Eve’s formation.

The command is given solely to Adam at this point, implying **he is held responsible** for communicating it (which becomes critical in chapter 3).

---

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.”

**YLT:**  
“But of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, thou dost not eat of it, for in the day of thine eating of it — dying thou dost die.”

**NIV:**  
“But you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for when you eat from it you will certainly die.”

_NIV replaces the Hebrew idiom with a plain paraphrase (“you will certainly die”), while KJV and YLT retain the structure more faithfully._

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

**Jubilees 3:17–20** — affirms the command and introduces the angelic presence guarding Eden, indicating its sacred and judicial nature.

**2 Esdras 3:7** — links Adam’s disobedience to the entrance of sin and death.

**Romans 5:12–19** — Paul centers this verse as the **origin of humanity’s need for redemption** — one act, one command, one fall.
