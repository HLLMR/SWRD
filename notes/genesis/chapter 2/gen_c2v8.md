### **GENESIS 2:8**

_Traditional Genesis 2:11_

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**The name of the first is Pishon — it is the one surrounding all the land of Havilah, where there is gold.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

שֵׁם הָאֶחָד פִּישׁוֹן  
הוּא הַסּוֹבֵב אֵת כָּל־אֶרֶץ הַחֲוִילָה  
אֲשֶׁר שָׁם הַזָּהָב

---

#### Transliteration:

_Shem ha’echad Pishon,  
hu ha’sovev et kol eretz ha-Chavilah,  
asher sham ha-zahav._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“The name of the one is Phison: this it is which encircles the whole land of Evilat, where there is gold.”

_LXX renders "Chavilah" as "Evilat" — likely a Greek phonetic approximation. Phrase structure follows MT._

---

#### DSS (4QGen-Exoda):

No notable variants. Text matches MT and confirms the name **Pishon** and the land of **Chavilah** with its gold.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“The name of the first is Pishon” (שֵׁם הָאֶחָד פִּישׁוֹן)**

- **Pishon** is an obscure name — no known river today can be definitively identified as such.
    
- “Ha’echad” = _the first_ — emphasizes a sequence and structure.
    

**“Surrounding all the land of Chavilah”**

- The verb _sovev_ = circling, encircling, or encompassing — suggests a **winding or boundary-defining river**.
    
- Chavilah is mentioned elsewhere (Gen 10:7, Gen 25:18) — generally associated with regions in Arabia or northeast Africa.
    

**“Where there is gold”**

- The note about gold indicates **abundance and resource richness** — Eden is not merely idyllic but materially bountiful.
    
- May also foreshadow gold’s symbolic use in sanctuaries (cf. Exod 25–28).
    

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- The identity of Pishon is often **ignored or allegorized** due to geographic uncertainty.
    
- Liberal critics treat these rivers as literary devices, missing the **topological and eschatological clues** they provide.
    
- The resource reference (gold) is frequently omitted in theology, though it ties to **later Temple imagery** and the **Garden–Tabernacle–Temple typology**.

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Anno Mundi 0**, Day 6 — describing the landscape surrounding Eden, immediately after its creation and Adam’s placement.

---

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“The name of the first is Pison: that is it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold.”

**YLT:**  
“The name of the first is Pison, it is that which is surrounding the whole land of the Havilah where the gold is,”

**NIV:**  
“The name of the first is the Pishon; it winds through the entire land of Havilah, where there is gold.”

_NIV uses “winds through,” an interpretive rendering of _sovev_ — valid, but less literal than “encompasses” or “surrounds.”_

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

**Jubilees 8:21–22** — places Havilah in the inheritance of Shem and later discusses its resources.

**Jasher 7:15** — mentions land divisions post-Flood with reference to river boundaries.

**1 Enoch 77:7** — references river names tied to angelic watchers and the flow of judgment — symbolic overlays may connect back to Eden’s original geography.
