### **GENESIS 2:16**

_Traditional Genesis 2:19_

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And YHWH Elohim formed from the ground every beast of the field and every bird of the sky, and brought them to the man to see what he would call them; and whatever the man called a living creature, that was its name.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וַיִּצֶר יְהוָה אֱלֹהִים  
מִן־הָאֲדָמָה  
כֹּל חַיַּת הַשָּׂדֶה וְאֵת כֹּל עוֹף הַשָּׁמַיִם  
וַיָּבֵא אֶל־הָאָדָם  
לִרְאוֹת מַה־יִּקְרָא־לוֹ  
וְכֹל אֲשֶׁר יִקְרָא־לוֹ הָאָדָם  
נֶפֶשׁ חַיָּה הוּא שְׁמוֹ

---

#### Transliteration:

_Vayyitzer YHWH Elohim min ha’adamah kol chayyat ha-sadeh ve’et kol of ha-shamayim;  
vayyave el ha’adam lirot mah yikra-lo,  
ve’chol asher yikra-lo ha’adam nefesh chayyah, hu shemo._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And God formed yet farther out of the ground all the beasts of the field and all the birds of the sky, and brought them to Adam to see what he would call them; and whatever Adam called each living soul, that was its name.”

_LXX includes the temporal word “yet farther” (ἔτι), implying these were formed **after** man, which is sometimes cited in “two-creation” theories._

---

#### DSS (4QGen-Exoda):

Mirrors MT. The sequence of verbs and order of creation (animals after Adam) is preserved — suggesting narrative **thematic sequencing** over strict chronology.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“Formed from the ground” (מִן־הָאֲדָמָה)**

- Same as Adam — _adamah_ emphasizes **shared material origin**.
    
- These creatures are earthly, unlike angelic or spiritual beings.
    

**“Beast of the field… bird of the sky”**

- _Sadeh_ = wild, uncultivated field — these are **non-domesticated animals**, not livestock.
    
- “Sky” = _shamayim_, indicating birds as part of the firmament ecology.
    

**“To see what he would call them” (לִרְאוֹת מַה־יִּקְרָא־לוֹ)**

- Indicates **divine curiosity or demonstration** — a test or display of Adam’s perceptive ability and authority.
    
- Implies language, reason, and **spiritual discernment**.
    

**“Whatever the man called… that was its name”**

- Hebrew structure shows **absolute delegation of authority**.
    
- Naming in Scripture equals **dominion** — this is an **exercise of Adam’s kingship** over creation (cf. Gen 1:28).
    

This event is not about companionship yet — it’s about **observation**, identity, and rulership.

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Critics claim Gen 2 contradicts Gen 1 due to apparent sequence reversal, but both MT and DSS suggest **a thematic retelling**, not a conflicting chronology.
    
- Liberal scholars often see this as mythic allegory rather than **real human spiritual cognition** — diminishing Adam’s unique role.
    
- The connection between **naming and dominion** is often overlooked in modern readings.

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Anno Mundi 0**, Day 6 — after Adam’s formation and prior to the formation of Eve.

This likely overlaps with **late Day 6**, setting the stage for the recognition of Adam’s incompleteness.

---

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them…”

**YLT:**  
“And Jehovah God formeth from the ground every beast of the field, and every fowl of the heavens, and bringeth in unto the man to see what he doth call it…”

**NIV:**  
“Now the LORD God had formed out of the ground all the wild animals and all the birds in the sky. He brought them to the man to see what he would name them…”

_NIV inserts “had formed” to harmonize with Gen 1 — an **editorial smoothing** not present in MT._

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

**Jubilees 3:27–29** — narrates the naming of animals and records that they were **subservient** to Adam.

**Sirach 17:4–6** — reflects on man being given “dominion over creatures” and “speech and understanding.”

**1 Enoch 85–89 (Animal Apocalypse)** — reflects symbolic association of animals and nations, implying early naming as spiritually significant.
