### **GENESIS 2:10**

_Traditional Genesis 2:13_

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And the name of the second river is Gihon — it is the one that surrounds all the land of Cush.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וְשֵׁם־הַנָּהָר הַשֵּׁנִי גִּיחוֹן  
הוּא הַסּוֹבֵב אֵת כָּל־אֶרֶץ כּוּשׁ

---

#### Transliteration:

_V’shem ha-nahar ha-sheni Gichon;  
hu ha-sovev et kol eretz Kush._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And the name of the second river is Geon: this it is which encircles the whole land of Ethiopia.”

_LXX equates “Cush” with “Ethiopia,” reflecting the common Septuagint-era interpretation. “Geon” is the Greek transliteration of “Gihon.”_

---

#### DSS (4QGen-Exoda):

The text confirms the MT wording, including “Gihon” and “Cush.” No known deviations in this clause.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“Gihon” (גִּיחוֹן)**

- Name related to the Hebrew root _gachah_ (burst forth / gush), indicating a **springing or surging river**.
    
- Also the name of a spring near Jerusalem (1 Kings 1:33) — possibly a **later symbolic echo** or naming tradition.
    

**“Encircles all the land of Cush” (אֶרֶץ כּוּשׁ)**

- Cush is traditionally equated with **Upper Egypt / Sudan / Ethiopia**, but ancient usage may have been broader.
    
- Suggests a **southern or eastern reach**, depending on Eden’s debated location.
    

**Geographic tensions**

- If taken literally, this river would stretch from the vicinity of Eden (often placed in Mesopotamia or Armenia) toward African regions — causing **many to question literal mapping**.
    
- The phrase “surrounds” (sovev) could indicate a **regional proximity or administrative dominion**, not a continuous river loop.

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Modern critics treat the Eden rivers as either **pure mythology** or **anachronistic editorial inserts**.
    
- Some translations interpret “Cush” geographically without context — potentially **missing ancestral or territorial meanings** that predate post-Flood nations.
    
- Gihon’s connection to later **Temple geography** (e.g., Solomon’s coronation at Gihon Spring) is rarely acknowledged.

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Anno Mundi 0**, Day 6 — continuing the description of Eden’s geographic context and boundaries. Still pre-Fall.

---

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia.”

**YLT:**  
“And the name of the second river is Gibon, it is that which is surrounding the whole land of Cush;”

**NIV:**  
“The name of the second river is the Gihon; it winds through the entire land of Cush.”

_NIV softens the action with “winds through” instead of “surrounds,” and keeps “Cush” instead of translating it as “Ethiopia” like the KJV._

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

**Jubilees 8:21–22** — references Cush as part of Ham’s inherited territory after the Flood, which may reflect Edenic borders.

**1 Enoch 17–18** — includes river references in the context of angelic judgment locations, possibly reflecting ancient memory of Eden’s topography.

**Psalm 46:4** — “There is a river whose streams make glad the city of God” — some scholars see this as a spiritualized echo of Eden’s fourfold river.
