### **GENESIS 2:18**

_Traditional Genesis 2:21_

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And YHWH Elohim caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and he slept. And He took one of his sides and closed up the flesh in its place.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וַיַּפֵּל יְהוָה אֱלֹהִים  
תַּרְדֵּמָה עַל־הָאָדָם וַיִּישָׁן  
וַיִּקַּח אַחַת מִצַּלְעֹתָיו  
וַיִּסְגֹּר בָּשָׂר תַּחְתֶּנָּה

---

#### Transliteration:

_Vayyapel YHWH Elohim tardemah al ha’adam, vayyishan;  
vayyikach achat mitzalotav,  
vayisgor basar takhtenah._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And God brought a trance upon Adam, and he slept; and He took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh in its place.”

_LXX uses “trance” (ἔκστασις) — indicating not just physical sleep but a divinely induced, profound unconsciousness._

---

#### DSS (4QGen-Exoda):

Matches MT. Confirms the use of _tardemah_ (deep sleep) and _tzela_ (side, rib). No deviations or expansions noted.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“Caused a deep sleep to fall” (תַּרְדֵּמָה)**

- _Tardemah_ = deep, divine sleep — used elsewhere for **prophetic visions** (e.g., Abraham in Gen 15:12; Saul’s camp in 1 Sam 26:12).
    
- This is not mere anesthesia — it's a **spiritual suspension**, possibly symbolic of death and resurrection.
    

**“Took one of his sides” (אַחַת מִצַּלְעֹתָיו)**

- _Tzela_ = side, rib, flank — used architecturally (e.g., side of the Ark or Tabernacle).
    
- Likely **more than just a rib** — the term implies a **structural portion**, perhaps even part of his heart-protecting side.
    
- Emphasizes **shared essence** — not from his head (to rule), nor his feet (to be trampled), but from his side — **to walk beside him**.
    

**“Closed up the flesh” (וַיִּסְגֹּר בָּשָׂר)**

- Healing is implied. This is **surgical language**, but miraculously restorative.
    
- The action completes the process: **separation for union**.

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Traditional renderings as simply “rib” trivialize the depth of the Hebrew — leading to weak or mocking interpretations of woman’s origin.
    
- Some liberal readings deconstruct this as myth or patriarchal fabrication, ignoring the **mutuality and mystery** embedded in the text.
    
- Conversely, some conservative commentators over-literalize “rib” while ignoring its architectural and symbolic richness.

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Anno Mundi 0**, late Day 6 — this act **completes** the formation of mankind in dual form: male and female.

This may be viewed as the **culmination** of the creation of Adam — not a separate act, but the full revelation of mankind's image-bearing design.

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof.”

**YLT:**  
“And Jehovah God causeth a deep sleep to fall on the man, and he sleepeth, and He taketh one of his ribs, and closeth up flesh in its stead.”

**NIV:**  
“So the LORD God caused the man to fall into a deep sleep; and while he was sleeping, he took one of the man's ribs and then closed up the place with flesh.”

_All versions translate _tzela_ as “rib,” which flattens the meaning. Only the LXX hints at the **spiritual magnitude** of the moment (“trance”)._

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

**Jubilees 3:8–10** — recounts this act with specific language about Adam rejoicing at seeing “bone of his bones,” confirming the side-origin.

**1 Corinthians 11:8–12** — Paul references this verse to affirm **interdependence**, not superiority, between man and woman.

**Ephesians 5:30–32** — uses this event typologically to describe **Messiah and His bride**, the Assembly, as “of His body.”
