### **GENESIS 2:7**

_(Traditional Genesis 2:10)_

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And a river went out from Eden to water the garden, and from there it separated and became four heads.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וְנָהָר יֹצֵא מֵעֵדֶן לְהַשְׁקוֹת אֶת־הַגָּן  
וּמִשָּׁם יִפָּרֵד  
וְהָיָה לְאַרְבָּעָה רָאשִׁים

---

#### Transliteration:

_V’nahar yotzei me’Eden l’hashqot et ha-gan,  
u’misham yippared,  
v’hayah l’arba’ah rashim._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And a river proceeded out of Eden to water the garden, and thence it divided itself and became four heads.”

_The LXX aligns almost identically with MT. The word “proceeded” reflects the Hebrew imperfect “yotzei” (is going out / went out)._

---

#### DSS (4QGen-Exoda):

Text confirms the Masoretic structure. The syntax and phrasing are stable; no significant variants noted.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“A river went out from Eden” (וְנָהָר יֹצֵא מֵעֵדֶן)**

- The source is **not the garden** itself, but **Eden as a greater region**.
    
- “Yotzei” (is going out) is imperfect — it **suggests ongoing action**. The river perpetually flowed from Eden to sustain the garden.
    

**“To water the garden” (לְהַשְׁקוֹת אֶת־הַגָּן)**

- Eden’s self-sustaining nature is reaffirmed here — no rain needed (cf. Gen 2:6).
    
- This verse is a **geographic and theological anchor**, establishing Eden as the **source of life and nourishment**.
    

**“From there it separated and became four heads” (וּמִשָּׁם יִפָּרֵד וְהָיָה לְאַרְבָּעָה רָאשִׁים)**

- “Rashim” = heads, origins, sources — possibly referring to **tributaries or diverging rivers**.
    
- The structure suggests **one source, four directions** — this mirrors later apocalyptic visions of divine water flowing from a central throne (cf. Ezekiel 47, Revelation 22).

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Many modern maps or reconstructions of Eden ignore this central river system or treat it allegorically.
    
- The idea of **fourfold division** (symbolizing completeness or dominion) is flattened in critical scholarship that dismisses Eden as myth.
    
- Some translations obscure the **geographic realism** by downplaying the origin/directionality of the river system.

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Anno Mundi 0**, Day 6 — describing the ecological infrastructure of Eden in which Adam is already placed.  
This is **pre-Fall**, pre-command — an ideal setting.

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads.”

**YLT:**  
“And a river is going out from Eden to water the garden, and from thence it is parted, and hath become four chief [rivers].”

**NIV:**  
“A river watering the garden flowed from Eden; from there it was separated into four headwaters.”

_NIV’s “headwaters” is interpretive — the Hebrew “rashim” simply means “heads.” This may imply **tributaries or river branches**, not separate sources._

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

**Jubilees 8:16–17** — later references to the river system as part of dividing the earth among Noah’s sons.

**1 Enoch 17–18** — visionary river and abyss imagery, potentially echoing Edenic origins.

**Revelation 22:1–2** — Edenic restoration in the New Jerusalem, with a single river and the Tree of Life on both sides.
