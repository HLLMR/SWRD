### **GENESIS 2:5**

_(Traditional Genesis 2:8)_

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And YHWH Elohim planted a garden in Eden, in the east; and there He placed the man whom He had formed.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וַיִּטַּע יְהוָה אֱלֹהִים גַּן־בְּעֵדֶן מִקֶּדֶם  
וַיָּשֶׂם שָׁם אֶת־הָאָדָם אֲשֶׁר יָצָר

---

#### Transliteration:

_Vayyita YHWH Elohim gan b’Eden miqqedem,  
vayyasem sham et ha’adam asher yatzar._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And the Lord God planted a garden eastward in Edem, and placed there the man whom He had formed.”

_“Edem” is the transliteration of Eden; "eastward" matches “miqqedem,” though the LXX sometimes emphasizes geography more than covenantal directionality._

---

#### DSS (4QGen-Exoda):

Confirms the Masoretic structure, including the preposition “miqqedem” (from the east / in the east). No variant readings in this clause.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“Planted a garden” (וַיִּטַּע גַּן)**

- This is **not** the general earth-wide vegetation of Gen 1:11 — Eden is **a distinct, enclosed environment**.
    
- The verb _vayyita_ (he planted) implies **intentional design**, not spontaneous sprouting.
    

**“In Eden” (בְּעֵדֶן)**

- “Eden” = delight, pleasure — not just a location but a **spiritually charged zone**.
    
- Appears as both **region and garden** — Eden is the land; the Garden is within it.
    

**“In the east” (מִקֶּדֶם)**

- Literally “from the east” or “eastward.”
    
- May have theological implication — **east** often associated with **divine encounters, exile, or return** (e.g., cherubim guarding east of Eden in Gen 3:24; Messiah from the east in Ezekiel 43:2).
    

**“There He placed the man” (וַיָּשֶׂם שָׁם אֶת־הָאָדָם)**

- Adam is not created _in_ the garden, but _relocated_ there after being formed.
    
- Reinforces the **separateness and sacredness** of Eden — it is a prepared place, not general terrain.
    

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Some readings imply Eden was the **whole Earth** — but the Hebrew consistently treats it as a **bounded region**.
    
- Allegorical interpretations obscure Eden’s **real, geographical character**.
    
- Eden’s “eastward” designation gets spiritualized or ignored — when in fact it plays a central role in many directional themes in prophecy and judgment.

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Anno Mundi 0**, Day 6 — shortly after the formation of Adam.  
This is Adam’s **relocation**, not his formation, into a distinct habitat prepared by YHWH Elohim for covenantal purposes.

---

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there He put the man whom He had formed.”

**YLT:**  
“And Jehovah God planteth a garden in Eden, at the east, and He setteth there the man whom He hath formed.”

**NIV:**  
“Now the LORD God had planted a garden in the east, in Eden; and there He put the man He had formed.”

_NIV adds “had planted,” suggesting past action, but this is not grammatically required in Hebrew. The emphasis is on the act itself — immediate and deliberate._

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

**Jubilees 3:8–9** — expands the location and purpose of Eden; introduces its central role in man’s testing and angelic attention.

**Jasher 1:9–10** — describes God placing Adam in Eden and assigning care over it.

**1 Enoch 24–27** — locates Eden in a visionary geography tied to future judgment and resurrection.
