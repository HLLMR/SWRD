### **GENESIS 2:17**

_Traditional Genesis 2:20_

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And the man gave names to all the livestock, and to the birds of the sky, and to every living creature of the field; but for the man, there was not found a helper corresponding to him.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וַיִּקְרָא הָאָדָם שֵׁמוֹת  
לְכָל־הַבְּהֵמָה  
וּלְעוֹף הַשָּׁמַיִם  
וּלְכֹל חַיַּת הַשָּׂדֶה  
וּלְאָדָם לֹא־נִמְצָא עֵזֶר כְּנֶגְדּוֹ

---

#### Transliteration:

_Vayyikra ha’adam shemot  
le’khol ha’behemah,  
u’le’of ha’shamayim,  
u’le’khol chayyat ha’sadeh;  
u’le’adam lo nimtsa ezer ke-negdo._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And Adam gave names to all the cattle and to all the birds of the sky, and to all the wild beasts of the field; but for Adam there was not found a helper like to himself.”

---

#### DSS (4QGen-Exoda):

Fully consistent with MT; confirms _ezer ke-negdo_ and the threefold animal categories.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“Gave names” (וַיִּקְרָא שֵׁמוֹת)**

- Naming is more than classification — it’s an **act of recognition, dominion, and spiritual discernment**.
    
- Adam is not inventing identity — he’s perceiving and affirming what Elohim created.
    

**Three categories of animals:**

1. **Livestock (הַבְּהֵמָה)** — typically domesticated animals (oxen, sheep).
    
2. **Birds of the sky (עוֹף הַשָּׁמַיִם)** — flying creatures aligned with the firmament.
    
3. **Field creatures (חַיַּת הַשָּׂדֶה)** — as previously discussed, uncultivated land animals.
    

These match the **taxonomy of Genesis 1:24–25**, suggesting a unified system of order.

**“But for the man, no helper was found” (וְלְאָדָם לֹא־נִמְצָא עֵזֶר כְּנֶגְדּוֹ)**

- The naming process **intensifies the absence** of a proper counterpart.
    
- No animal, despite their diversity, mirrors Adam’s nature — **none are fit for covenantal partnership**.
    
- The verb _nimtsa_ (נִמְצָא) implies **search and evaluation** — not just that a helper wasn't made, but **none could be found** among what already existed.

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Some modern commentaries read this as Adam seeking a mate among the animals — a notion **absent from the text** and contrary to its tone.
    
- The process was pedagogical — Elohim leading Adam to **recognize** his need, not frustrating him.
    
- Some translations obscure the **ezer ke-negdo** construction, softening it into helper/subordinate language — rather than **equal counterpart**.

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Anno Mundi 0**, late Day 6 — this is the **final event before the creation of woman**, and serves as its theological foundation.

---

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found an help meet for him.”

**YLT:**  
“And the man calleth names to all the cattle, and to the fowl of the heavens, and to every beast of the field; and to man hath not been found an helper — as his counterpart.”

**NIV:**  
“So the man gave names to all the livestock, the birds in the sky and all the wild animals. But for Adam no suitable helper was found.”

_NIV uses “suitable helper,” which softens the rich meaning of _ezer ke-negdo_. YLT preserves the nuance best._

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

**Jubilees 3:29** — confirms that Adam named all creatures and notes that **none were his equal**.

**Sirach 36:24–25** — reiterates that **a wife is a man’s true counterpart**, reinforcing the need revealed here.

**1 Corinthians 11:9** — Paul echoes this passage when discussing divine order: “The woman was created for the man.”
