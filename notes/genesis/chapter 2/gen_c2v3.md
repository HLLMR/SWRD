### **GENESIS 2:3**

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And a mist went up from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וְאֵד יַעֲלֶה מִן־הָאָרֶץ  
וְהִשְׁקָה אֶת־כָּל־פְּנֵי הָאֲדָמָה

---

#### Transliteration:

_Ve’ed ya’aleh min-ha’aretz,  
v’hishqah et kol p’nei ha’adamah._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

"But there rose a fountain out of the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground."

_LXX renders אֵד (_'ed*) as “fountain,” diverging from the typical translation of “mist” or “vapor.” This may reflect interpretive tradition or environmental understanding.*

---

#### DSS (4QGen-Exoda):

Text matches the Masoretic with no deviations noted in this verse. Confirms אֵד (’ed) and supports the “mist” rendering.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“A mist went up from the earth” (וְאֵד יַעֲלֶה מִן־הָאָרֶץ)**

- **’Ed** (אֵד) is a rare Hebrew word, understood as **mist**, **vapor**, or **subsurface moisture**.
    
- This verse supports a **dew-based hydrological system** in the pre-Flood world — no rainfall mentioned until the Flood narrative in Genesis 7.
    
- The LXX translation of "fountain" might reflect a **conceptual overlap** with subterranean waters (see “fountains of the deep” in Gen 7:11).
    

**“Watered the whole face of the ground”**

- Reinforces Eden as a uniquely **self-sustained environment**, distinct from modern agronomy.
    
- This phrase bridges directly to v.4–7, where man is formed from this ground — already moistened and prepared.

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Rain-based paradigms in modern theology often skip this verse, leading to confusion about how the Earth was sustained before the Flood.
    
- The pre-Flood ecosystem described here contrasts sharply with post-Flood climatology — **ignored by many creationist and evolutionary models alike**.
    
- The LXX’s “fountain” can cause confusion when not checked against the Hebrew — though the imagery may have been _deliberately interpretive_ to parallel Eden’s rivers (v.10).

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Anno Mundi 0**, immediate prelude to the forming of man.  
This verse paints the ecological scene into which Adam will be introduced — **fertile, watered earth**, prepared by divine design, not rainfall.

---

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.”

**YLT:**  
“And a mist goeth up from the earth, and hath watered the whole face of the ground.”

Both align closely with MT, although YLT's use of present tense (“goeth”) is somewhat interpretive.

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

**Jubilees 2:6–7** — Aligns with the Eden narrative, describing the land before trees and vegetation, and the water cycle being distinct from ours.

**Jasher 1:6–7** — Describes Eden’s richness and divine provisioning as a unique system unlike other lands.

**1 Enoch 10:22–23** — Describes rivers and springs flowing in Eden, potentially connected to this mist-based source of hydration.
