### **GENESIS 2:1** (formerly GENESIS 2:4)

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**These are the generations of the heavens and the earth when they were created — in the day that YHWH Elohim made the earth and the heavens.**

- **Hebrew (MT)**:  
    אֵלֶּה תּוֹלְדֹתוֹת הַשָּׁמַיִם וְהָאָרֶץ בְּהִבָּרְאָם בְּיוֹם עֲשׂוֹת יְהוָה אֱלֹהִים אֶרֶץ וְשָׁמָיִם
    
- **Transliteration**:  
    _Eleh toledot ha’shamayim ve’ha’aretz b’hibaram, b’yom asot YHWH Elohim eretz ve’shamayim._
    
- **LXX (Brenton)**:  
    “This is the book of the generation of heaven and earth, when they were made, in the day in which the Lord God made the heaven and the earth.”
    

> 📘 LXX adds the phrase “**book of** the generation” (_biblos geneseos_), perhaps editorially. MT lacks the word for “book” here.

- **DSS (4QGen-Exoda)**:  
    Follows MT — no mention of “book”; confirms “YHWH Elohim” compound name appears here first.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

#### **“These are the generations of…” (אֵלֶּה תּוֹלְדֹתוֹת)**

- **Toledot (תּוֹלְדֹת)** = "generations," "account," or "descendants" — a **structural marker** in Genesis.
    
    - This is the **first toledot heading** in Scripture.
        
    - It does **not mean** the beginning of history — it introduces the **detailed unfolding** of what was just summarized.
        
- Toledot formulas mark **scroll divisions** and transitions to **narrative focus** in Genesis (e.g., Adam, Noah, Shem, Terah, etc.).
    

#### **“In the day that YHWH Elohim made…”**

- **First appearance** of the **compound Name**: **YHWH Elohim (יְהוָה אֱלֹהִים)**.
    
    - Prior to this, only **Elohim** is used.
        
    - Now that the narrative zooms into the creation of **man**, we see **covenant Name (YHWH)** — suggesting intimacy and personal relationship.
        
- “In the day” (בְּיוֹם) — idiomatic for a **time period**, not just a 24-hour segment.
    
    - This phrase refers back to **all six creation days**, not just one.
        

#### **“Earth and heavens” (אֶרֶץ וְשָׁמַיִם)** — reversed order

- Flip of the formula “heavens and earth” from Gen 1:1.
    
    - This reversal signals the **focus has shifted from cosmic scale to earthly, human-centered detail**.
        
    - Genesis 1 = **Elohim’s cosmic creation**, Genesis 2 = **YHWH’s covenantal shaping of man and Eden**.

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Many critics claim Gen 1 and Gen 2 are **conflicting accounts** — but this **verse explicitly links** the two:
    
    - Gen 1 is the **overview**;
        
    - Gen 2 begins the **detailed narrative** of man’s role in that creation.
        
- Higher critics treat “Elohim” and “YHWH” as proof of **multiple contradictory sources** (JEDP theory) — but the combined name **YHWH Elohim** refutes this artificial division.
    
- LXX's addition of “book of” introduces confusion, as no “book” is referenced in MT — this may reflect later editorial traditions.

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

- **AM 0, post-Day 7** — this toledot marks the beginning of the **Eden narrative**, not a new timeline.
    
- What follows may **recap Day 6** from man’s perspective and extend **slightly beyond** in terms of context and environment.

### 📖 Comparison:

- **KJV**: “These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens.”
    
    - Preserves word order and compound name.
        
- **YLT**: “These are births of the heavens and of the earth in their being prepared, in the day of Jehovah God's making earth and heavens.”
    
    - “Births” is literal for _toledot_ but can be misleading in modern English.

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

- **Jubilees 2:1–3** — also distinguishes between the **creation week** and what follows, including **angels and Eden preparation**.
    
- **Book of Jasher 1** — picks up directly here with the **formation of Adam from dust**.
    
- **1 Enoch** remains parallel but indirect; picks up significance later once watchers and rebellion enter.
