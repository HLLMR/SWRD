_Traditional Genesis 2:16_

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And YHWH Elohim commanded the man, saying, “From every tree of the garden you may surely eat.”**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וַיְצַו יְהוָה אֱלֹהִים עַל־הָאָדָם לֵאמֹר  
מִכֹּל עֵץ־הַגָּן אָכֹל תֹּאכֵל

---

#### Transliteration:

_Vayyetzav YHWH Elohim al ha’adam lemor:  
mikol etz ha-gan akhol to’khel._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And the Lord God gave a charge to Adam, saying, ‘Of every tree which is in the garden, thou mayest freely eat…’”

_The LXX reflects the doubled Hebrew infinitive for emphasis (“freely eat”)._

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“And YHWH Elohim commanded the man” (וַיְצַו ... עַל־הָאָדָם)**

- _Vayyetzav_ (commanded) is a strong verb — a formal **legal or covenantal instruction**, not casual advice.
    
- This is the **first commandment** ever given in Scripture — not “do not eat,” but rather **permission to eat freely**.
    

**“From every tree… you may surely eat” (מִכֹּל עֵץ־הַגָּן אָכֹל תֹּאכֵל)**

- Hebrew doubles the verb (_akhol tokhel_) — idiomatic for **“you may surely eat”** or **“you are absolutely permitted.”**
    
- The phrasing mirrors **covenant treaty language**, where stipulations are clearly granted or prohibited.
    

This verse is sometimes overshadowed by the prohibition in the next verse, but it’s crucial: **God’s first command to man was generous, not restrictive**.

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Many theological frameworks **begin with prohibition and sin**, missing that the **first divine act of governance was permission and provision**.
    
- The dual verb emphasis is frequently flattened or omitted in English, **diminishing the tone of abundance**.
    
- Eden is often framed as a “test” environment — but this verse shows it as a place of **gifted access and freedom**, within protective boundaries.

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Anno Mundi 0**, Day 6 — this likely occurs immediately after Adam is placed and charged with tending the Garden.

This command establishes **covenantal relationship** before Eve is formed, reinforcing Adam’s role as first recipient and transmitter of divine law.

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat…”

**YLT:**  
“And Jehovah God layeth a charge on the man, saying, ‘Of every tree of the garden eating thou dost eat…’”

**NIV:**  
“And the LORD God commanded the man, ‘You are free to eat from any tree in the garden…’”

_KJV and YLT preserve the **emphatic repetition**, though in old English form. NIV simplifies the structure but retains the permissive tone._

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

**Jubilees 3:15–17** — directly parallels this passage, emphasizing the command as a **spoken covenant** with Adam.

**2 Baruch 15:1–3** — interprets this moment as the beginning of man’s **moral awareness and accountability**, reinforcing its covenantal gravity.

**Romans 5:12–14** — Paul draws a direct line from **this command** to the entrance of sin and death, underscoring its theological weight.
