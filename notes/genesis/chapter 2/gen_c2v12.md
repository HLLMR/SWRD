### **GENESIS 2:12**

_Traditional Genesis 2:15_

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And YHWH Elohim took the man and caused him to rest in the Garden of Eden, to serve it and to guard it.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וַיִּקַּח יְהוָה אֱלֹהִים אֶת־הָאָדָם  
וַיַּנִּחֵהוּ בְּגַן־עֵדֶן  
לְעָבְדָהּ וּלְשָׁמְרָהּ

---

#### Transliteration:

_Vayyikach YHWH Elohim et ha’adam,  
vayyanniḥehu b’Gan-Eden,  
l’ovdah u’l’shomrah._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And the Lord God took the man whom He had formed, and placed him in the garden of Delight, to work it and to keep it.”

_LXX renders “Eden” as “Delight,” a literal translation of the name._

---

#### DSS (4QGen-Exoda):

Confirms Masoretic text — no variants recorded for this clause. Both infinitives (_to serve_ and _to guard_) are present.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“Caused him to rest” (וַיַּנִּחֵהוּ)**

- Not just “placed” — this verb shares root with **nuach**, the word for _rest_, and is used for **Sabbath rest** in Exodus 20:11.
    
- This signals a **deliberate act of placement for sacred rest**, not simply geographic relocation.
    

**“To serve it” (לְעָבְדָהּ)**

- Root: _avad_ — can mean **work, serve, or worship**.
    
- Used extensively in **Levitical service language** (cf. Numbers 3:7–8, Deuteronomy 10:8).
    
- Indicates Adam’s role was more than agricultural: **he was a priest in sacred space**.
    

**“To guard it” (וּלְשָׁמְרָהּ)**

- Root: _shamar_ — to watch, preserve, or protect.
    
- Also used in **temple and covenant contexts**, such as guarding the ark or keeping the commandments.
    

Together, these terms reflect a **spiritual stewardship** — Eden as the **first sanctuary**, Adam as its **first priest-guardian**.

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Traditional interpretations minimize the **worship and priesthood** dimensions of Adam’s role, focusing instead on physical labor.
    
- Eden is wrongly portrayed as **idyllic leisure**, but this verse shows it to be a **sacred commission**.
    
- The **temple parallels** (Garden, Tabernacle, Temple) are often overlooked in favor of moral allegory or Enlightenment rationalism.

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Anno Mundi 0**, Day 6 — after Adam’s creation and the formation of the Garden.

This verse describes Adam’s commissioning, prior to the creation of Eve and the giving of moral commands.

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.”

**YLT:**  
“And Jehovah God taketh the man, and causeth him to rest in the garden of Eden, to serve it, and to keep it.”

**NIV:**  
“The LORD God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to work it and take care of it.”

_KJV and NIV emphasize **labor**, whereas YLT is closer to the **rest + service** dual meaning. Our rendering seeks to balance both while maintaining theological depth._

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

**Jubilees 3:12–14** — confirms that Adam was placed in the Garden to **cultivate and protect it**, linking this to sacred responsibility.

**Exodus 40:13–16** — the **ordination of priests** echoes this original Edenic function: sacred rest + sacred work.

**1 Enoch 24–25** — the Edenic vision includes imagery of protected holy ground and fruitful trees, guarded and maintained by divine order.
