### **GENESIS 2:4**

_(Traditional Genesis 2:7)_

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**Then YHWH Elohim formed the man from the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and the man became a living being.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וַיִּיצֶר יְהוָה אֱלֹהִים אֶת־הָאָדָם עָפָר מִן־הָאֲדָמָה  
וַיִּפַּח בְּאַפָּיו נִשְׁמַת חַיִּים  
וַיְהִי הָאָדָם לְנֶפֶשׁ חַיָּה

---

#### Transliteration:

_Vayyitzer YHWH Elohim et ha’adam afar min ha’adamah,  
vayyipach b’appav nishmat chayyim,  
vayehi ha’adam l’nefesh chayyah._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And God formed the man of dust from the earth, and breathed upon his face the breath of life, and man became a living soul.”

_Minor grammatical variation: “upon his face” rather than “into his nostrils.”_

---

#### DSS (4QGen-Exoda):

Conforms to the Masoretic in structure and wording. All major elements — **formation from dust**, **breath of life**, and **living being** — are intact. Supports the MT as stable.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“Formed the man” (וַיִּיצֶר אֶת־הָאָדָם)**

- “Vayyitzer” (formed) uses a **double yod**, suggesting intensity or deliberation — possibly foreshadowing dual aspects of man (spirit and flesh).
    
- **Adam** (the man) comes from **adamah** (the ground), highlighting material origin and linguistic wordplay.
    

**“From the dust of the ground” (עָפָר מִן־הָאֲדָמָה)**

- “Afar” = fine dust, dry earth — elemental, lifeless matter.
    
- Man is **not created ex nihilo**, but **formed from pre-existing material**.
    

**“Breathed into his nostrils the breath of life” (נִשְׁמַת חַיִּים)**

- Divine breath (nishmat) is not just air — it represents **spiritual life, consciousness, and divine spark**.
    
- Distinct from animals; this is not just animation, but **image-bearing capacity** (cf. Gen 1:26).
    

**“Man became a living being” (לְנֶפֶשׁ חַיָּה)**

- “Nefesh chayyah” = living soul or living creature — same term used for animals (Gen 1:24), yet here **with divine breath**.
    
- Man shares biological life with animals but receives **a unique origin and mandate**.

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Some translations obscure the spiritual nature of this act, reducing it to mere animation or metaphor.
    
- Modern theology often overlooks the **contrast** between man’s dust-formed body and the divinely imparted breath — a **fusion of heaven and earth**.
    
- Higher criticism separates this from Genesis 1 as a different creation account, despite the unified compound Name **YHWH Elohim** and seamless thematic continuation.

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Anno Mundi 0**, Day 6 — though occurring _after_ the initial “male and female” summary of Gen 1:27, this verse zooms in on the specific process of forming Adam before the creation of Eve.

---

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.”

**YLT:**  
“And Jehovah God formeth the man — dust from the ground, and breatheth into his nostrils breath of life, and the man becometh a living creature.”

**NIV:**  
“Then the LORD God formed a man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living being.”

_NIV is mostly faithful, though “a man” subtly implies non-specificity, which contrasts with the Hebrew ha’adam (“the man”)._

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

**Jubilees 3:4–6** — expands on Adam’s formation and introduces his immediate placement into the Garden.

**Jasher 1:7–9** — details the forming of man, his frame, and the divine breath giving him understanding.

**1 Enoch 62:5–6** — while later and apocalyptic, speaks of the breath of life residing in the righteous — a likely callback to this original moment.
