### **GENESIS 2:11**

_Traditional Genesis 2:14_

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And the name of the third river is Hiddekel — it is the one that flows east of Asshur. And the fourth river is the Euphrates.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וְשֵׁם הַנָּהָר הַשְּׁלִישִׁי חִדֶּקֶל  
הוּא הַהֹלֵךְ קִדְמַת אַשּׁוּר  
וְהַנָּהָר הָרְבִיעִי הוּא פְרָת

---

#### Transliteration:

_V’shem ha-nahar ha-shelishi Chiddeqel,  
hu ha-holekh kidmat Asshur;  
v’ha-nahar ha-revi’i hu Perat._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And the third river is Tigris: this is the one which flows over against the Assyrians. And the fourth river is Euphrates.”

_LXX correctly equates **Hiddekel** with the **Tigris River**, and **Perat** with the **Euphrates**. “Kidmat Asshur” rendered “over against the Assyrians” — reflecting spatial approximation._

#### DSS (4QGen-Exoda):

Confirms MT wording. No recorded textual deviations for this verse in the scroll fragments.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“Hiddekel” (חִדֶּקֶל)**

- This is the **Hebrew name for the Tigris River**, known from multiple ancient sources.
    
- The verb _holekh_ = “is going” or “flows” — describing directional movement.
    
- “Kidmat Asshur” (קִדְמַת אַשּׁוּר) = **east of Asshur** (or **before Asshur**, depending on directionality conventions).
    

**“Asshur”**

- Ambiguity exists — could refer to **the man (son of Shem)** or **the nation/region (Assyria)**.
    
- If Asshur is a region already named in the pre-Flood context, it may signal **editorial preservation of ancient names** by Moses, retrofitted for clarity.
    

**“The fourth river is Perat” (פְּרָת)**

- This is **Euphrates**, the most well-known and longest river in the region.
    
- No additional description — likely because it was so well-known to ancient audiences that it required no elaboration.

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Attempts to **symbolize** the rivers ignore their role in anchoring Eden within **tangible geography**.
    
- Critics who assign the names as **post-Flood backprojections** often disregard the **semantic integrity** of Genesis as an eyewitness or preserved account.
    
- The briefness of the Euphrates mention is often used to claim inconsistency — but this likely reflects its cultural ubiquity.

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Anno Mundi 0**, Day 6 — this finalizes the river system of Eden, forming a fourfold watercourse out of a single source.

This configuration may have been **radically altered by the Flood**, explaining present-day geographic discontinuities.

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which goeth toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river is Euphrates.”

**YLT:**  
“And the name of the third river is Hiddekel, it is that which is going east of Asshur; and the fourth river is the Euphrates.”

**NIV:**  
“The name of the third river is the Tigris; it runs along the east side of Ashur. And the fourth river is the Euphrates.”

_NIV translates **Hiddekel** directly as “Tigris” and **Asshur** as “Ashur,” aligning with modern geography but removing some ancient ambiguity._

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

**Jubilees 8:22–23** — aligns river names with Noah’s sons' land inheritances, particularly Shem and Asshur.

**1 Enoch 17** — describes rivers flowing from mountains of judgment, possibly drawing on Edenic imagery.

**Daniel 10:4** — Daniel’s vision by the **Hiddekel** river may reflect deliberate literary connection to Eden.
