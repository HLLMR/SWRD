### **GENESIS 2:15**

_Traditional Genesis 2:18_

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And YHWH Elohim said, “It is not good for the man to be alone; I will make for him a helper corresponding to him.”**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וַיֹּאמֶר יְהוָה אֱלֹהִים  
לֹא־טוֹב הֱיוֹת הָאָדָם לְבַדּוֹ  
אֶעֱשֶׂה־לּוֹ עֵזֶר כְּנֶגְדּוֹ

---

#### Transliteration:

_Vayomer YHWH Elohim:  
lo-tov heyot ha’adam levado;  
e’eseh-lo ezer ke-negdo._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And the Lord God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; let us make for him a helper corresponding to him.”

_LXX follows the Hebrew closely, translating “ezer ke-negdo” with language meaning “like to him.”_

#### DSS (4QGen-Exoda):

Text mirrors MT exactly; all phrases intact, no deviations noted.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“It is not good” (לֹא־טוֹב)**

- This is the **first time in creation** something is declared _not good_.
    
- The statement carries weight — it disrupts the earlier rhythm of “and it was good.”
    
- It suggests that **relational incompleteness** is not fitting for the image-bearer.
    

**“For the man to be alone” (הָאָדָם לְבַדּוֹ)**

- Hebrew _levado_ = by himself, alone, solitary.
    
- More than just emotional loneliness — it implies a lack of **functional partnership** and **covenantal wholeness**.
    

**“A helper corresponding to him” (עֵזֶר כְּנֶגְדּוֹ)**

- _Ezer_ = help, support, ally — used of God Himself in many places (e.g., Psalm 33:20; Deut 33:26).
    
- _Ke-negdo_ = “corresponding to him,” “facing him,” or “alongside him” — **equal and opposite**, not subordinate.
    
- The phrase denotes **complementarity**, not hierarchy — someone suited to match and complete the man.
    

This is not about servitude but about **covenantal mutuality** and divine intentionality.

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Many traditional interpretations have read “helper” as **inferior**, when the Hebrew does not imply subordination.
    
- Misreading this verse has fueled centuries of poor theology about gender roles — despite _ezer_ often being a term for **divine strength and deliverance**.
    
- Some modern liberal readings reverse the error, claiming the woman is a correction — but the text is **not corrective**, it’s **completive**.

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Anno Mundi 0**, Day 6 — before Eve is formed, but after Adam has received his commands and commission.

This is a divine declaration of intent — setting up the **formation of woman** as the culmination of human creation.

---

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And the LORD God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him.”

**YLT:**  
“And Jehovah God saith, ‘Not good for the man to be alone, I do make to him an helper — as his counterpart.’”

**NIV:**  
“The LORD God said, ‘It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make a helper suitable for him.’”

_KJV’s phrase “help meet” is archaic and often misread as a single word. YLT and NIV better reflect the mutual suitability._

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

**Jubilees 3:4–5** — confirms the creation of woman as a **deliberate act of completeness**, and affirms the marriage covenant.

**Sirach 36:24** — “He that gets a wife begins a possession, a help like unto himself” — echoes this verse’s phrasing and theology.

**Ephesians 5:31–32** — Paul uses the union of man and woman as a **mystery reflecting Messiah and the Assembly**, linking all the way back to Eden.
