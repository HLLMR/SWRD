### **GENESIS 2:9**

_Traditional Genesis 2:12_

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And the gold of that land is good; there is the bdellium and the onyx stone.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וּזְהַב הָאָרֶץ הַהִוא טוֹב  
שָׁם הַבְּדֹלַח וְאֶבֶן הַשֹּׁהַם

---

#### Transliteration:

_U-zehav ha’aretz ha’hi tov;  
sham ha-bdolah v’even ha-shoham._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And the gold of that land is good; there also is carbuncle and emerald.”

_The LXX significantly deviates on the gem names: it renders “bdellium” as “carbuncle” and “onyx” as “emerald.” This may reflect translation tradition, not direct equivalence._

---

#### DSS (4QGen-Exoda):

Confirms the Masoretic wording. No gem name variants are preserved in the available fragments of this verse.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“Gold of that land is good” (זְהַב ... טוֹב)**

- “Tov” here implies not only quality but **moral or sacred value** — possibly foreshadowing its future use in sacred objects (cf. Exod 25:11).
    
- Reinforces the **material richness** of Eden-adjacent territory — Eden as source of divine abundance.
    

**“Bdellium” (הַבְּדֹלַח)**

- Ancient aromatic resin, possibly from trees in Arabia or Africa — associated with **fragrance and purification**.
    
- Also mentioned in **Numbers 11:7**, compared to manna — connecting Eden to later divine provision.
    

**“Onyx stone” (אֶבֶן הַשֹּׁהַם)**

- “Shoham” = precious stone, possibly onyx, beryl, or lapis lazuli depending on translation.
    
- One of the stones on the **high priest’s ephod (Exod 28:9)** — again pointing to Eden–Temple connections.
    

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Many modern translations **flatten or skip** these material details as irrelevant — but each element (gold, bdellium, onyx) reappears in **tabernacle and priestly contexts**, showing a **theological thread** from Eden to worship.
    
- LXX's gem substitution can obscure original meaning unless back-checked with the MT — possibly influenced by regional stone names or Greek gemology.

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Anno Mundi 0**, Day 6 — continuing the description of Edenic geography and resources immediately after man’s placement.

---

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the onyx stone.”

**YLT:**  
“and the gold of that land is good, there [is] the bdellium and the shoham stone;”

**NIV:**  
“The gold of that land is good; aromatic resin and onyx are also there.”

_NIV translates “bdellium” as “aromatic resin,” clarifying meaning but **losing the poetic and mystical resonance** of the Hebrew term._

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

**Jubilees 8:22** — mentions gold and resources linked to Noah’s sons and their inheritance.

**Exodus 28:9–20** — details the **priestly breastplate**, including onyx stones inscribed with names — drawing Eden’s material beauty into covenant worship.

**Revelation 21:18–20** — gem imagery returns in the New Jerusalem, possibly mirroring Edenic materials.
