### **GENESIS 2:6**

_(Traditional Genesis 2:9)_

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And YHWH Elohim caused to sprout from the ground every tree desirable in appearance and good for food, and the Tree of Life in the midst of the garden, and the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וַיַּצְמַח יְהוָה אֱלֹהִים מִן־הָאֲדָמָה  
כָּל־עֵץ נֶחְמָד לְמַרְאֶה וְטוֹב לְמַאֲכָל  
וְעֵץ הַחַיִּים בְּתוֹךְ הַגָּן  
וְעֵץ הַדַּעַת טוֹב וָרָע

---

#### Transliteration:

_Vayyatzmach YHWH Elohim min-ha’adamah kol-etz nechmad l’mar’eh v’tov l’ma’akhal,  
v’etz ha-chayyim b’tokh ha-gan,  
v’etz ha-da’at tov va-ra._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And God caused to spring up also out of the earth every tree beautiful to the sight and good for food, and the tree of life in the midst of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.”

_LXX closely follows the MT. The adjectives “beautiful” and “good” reflect Hebrew parallels. No deviation in tree identification._

---

#### DSS (4QGen-Exoda):

Supports the MT structure. No known textual variants in this verse. The phrasing of both **Tree of Life** and **Tree of Knowledge** appears intact.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“Caused to sprout” (וַיַּצְמַח)**

- Active verb — **God’s intentional cultivation**, not spontaneous growth.
    
- Reinforces Eden as **a cultivated environment**, not wilderness.
    

**“Every tree desirable in appearance and good for food”**

- Not just nutritional value — visual and aesthetic beauty are emphasized.
    
- This aligns with mankind’s **sensory and spiritual experience** of the garden — it was **delightful, not merely functional**.
    

**“Tree of Life… Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil”**

- These are **distinct and named trees**, not metaphors or symbolic clusters.
    
- Placed **in the midst** (בְּתוֹךְ) of the garden — the **centerpiece of Eden’s spiritual geography**.
    
- The order of naming matters: **life precedes knowledge** — a theological and narrative sequence.
    

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Liberal theology often spiritualizes the trees as mythological or metaphorical — yet the text gives **concrete placement, function, and consequence**.
    
- The term “knowledge of good and evil” is not inherently negative — it denotes **discernment, moral agency**, and possibly **judicial awareness** (as in 2 Sam 14:17).
    
- Some traditions conflate the Tree of Life with mystical allegory (e.g., Kabbalistic Sefirot), diverging from the plain Hebrew narrative.

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Anno Mundi 0**, Day 6 — immediately after Adam is placed in Eden.  
The trees are planted specifically for him, foreshadowing **choice, command, and consequence** in the covenantal testing to follow.

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the Tree of Life also in the midst of the garden, and the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil.”

**YLT:**  
“And Jehovah God causeth to sprout from the ground every tree desirable for sight, and good for food, and the Tree of Life in the midst of the garden, and the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil.”

**NIV:**  
“The LORD God made all kinds of trees grow out of the ground—trees that were pleasing to the eye and good for food. In the middle of the garden were the Tree of Life and the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil.”

_NIV paraphrases “caused to sprout” as “made… grow,” and omits the direct connection to the ground. Otherwise, it retains the order and emphasis of the MT._

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

**Jubilees 3:15–17** — elaborates on the location of the Tree of Life, its heavenly connection, and the separation from the Tree of Knowledge.

**Jasher 1:11–12** — briefly describes the trees and God's command to Adam.

**1 Enoch 24–25** — provides a visionary description of the Tree of Life as luminous and eternal, reserved for the righteous.
