### **GENESIS 2:21**

_Traditional Genesis 2:24_

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother, and shall cling to his woman, and they shall become one flesh.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

עַל־כֵּן  
יַעֲזָב אִישׁ אֶת־אָבִיו וְאֶת־אִמּוֹ  
וְדָבַק בְּאִשְׁתּוֹ  
וְהָיוּ לְבָשָׂר אֶחָד

---

#### Transliteration:

_Al-ken  
ya’azav ish et-aviv ve’et-imo,  
ve’davak be’ishto,  
ve’hayu le’vasar echad._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and shall cleave to his wife, and the two shall be one flesh.”

_Greek adds “the two” (οἱ δύο), clarifying the duality of the union — later quoted by Yeshua and Paul._

Agrees with MT; no notable variants.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“Therefore a man shall leave…” (עַל־כֵּן יַעֲזָב אִישׁ)**

- _Al-ken_ = “on account of this” — a direct **cause-and-effect link** to Adam’s declaration in the prior verse.
    
- Marks this as a **foundational principle**, not just a narrative moment.
    

**“Leave his father and his mother”**

- Striking — as Adam and Chavah had no parents.
    
- Suggests this is **spoken by the narrator** (or possibly added by Moses) as **universal theology**, not merely Adam’s voice.
    

**“Cling to his woman” (וְדָבַק בְּאִשְׁתּוֹ)**

- _Davak_ = to cling, stick, adhere — **covenantal loyalty**, not just physical union.
    
- Used later for spiritual **devotion to YHWH** (Deut 10:20, Psalm 63:8).
    

**“They shall become one flesh”**

- Not just sexual — this implies **total unity**: physical, emotional, spiritual, familial.
    
- Basis for the **doctrine of marriage**, later referenced by Messiah.

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Some theologies downplay the **pre-Fall origin** of marriage — but this verse firmly establishes it **before sin**.
    
- The Hebrew “woman” (_ishah_) is often translated “wife,” but **the term itself reflects the created identity**, not legal status.
    
- The unity of “one flesh” is sometimes misconstrued as subordination — but the Hebrew emphasizes **mutual union**, not dominance.

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Anno Mundi 0**, Day 6 — this statement concludes the Edenic creation and presents **the first covenant** established by Elohim: marriage.

---

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.”

**YLT:**  
“Therefore doth a man leave his father and his mother, and hath cleaved unto his wife, and they have become one flesh.”

**NIV:**  
“That is why a man leaves his father and mother and is united to his wife, and they become one flesh.”

_NIV adds “that is why,” correctly reflecting the causal connector _al-ken_. All three preserve the basic meaning._

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

**Matthew 19:4–6 & Mark 10:6–9** — Yeshua directly quotes this verse to affirm the sanctity and **permanence of marriage**.

**Ephesians 5:31–32** — Paul calls this union a **mystery**, referring to Messiah and the Assembly.

**Jubilees 3:12–14** — reiterates this principle in its recounting of the marriage of Adam and Chavah.
