### **GENESIS 2:2**

_(Traditional Genesis 2:5)_

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And every shrub of the field was not yet in the earth, and every herb of the field had not yet sprung up—for YHWH Elohim had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was no man to till the ground.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וְכֹל שִׂיחַ הַשָּׂדֶה טֶרֶם יִהְיֶה בָאָרֶץ  
וְכָל עֵשֶׂב הַשָּׂדֶה טֶרֶם יִצְמָח  
כִּי לֹא הִמְטִיר יְהוָה אֱלֹהִים עַל הָאָרֶץ  
וְאָדָם אַיִן לַעֲבֹד אֶת הָאֲדָמָה

---

#### Transliteration:

_V’khol si’ach ha-sadeh terem yihyeh va’aretz,  
v’khol esev ha-sadeh terem yitzmach,  
ki lo himtir YHWH Elohim al ha’aretz,  
v’adam ayin la’avod et ha’adamah._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And no grass of the field had yet sprung up, for God had not rained upon the earth, and there was not a man to cultivate it.”

_LXX simplifies the phrasing; “shrub” and “herb” distinctions are not preserved. “God” renders as κύριος ὁ θεός (Kyrios ho Theos), consistent with YHWH Elohim._

---

#### DSS (4QGen-Exoda):

Aligns with the Masoretic Text. The phrasing of “YHWH Elohim” is present, and no variations are noted in this verse. The structure matches exactly, supporting MT as stable here.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“Every shrub… every herb of the field”**

- The text refers to local flora — specifically **uncultivated (shrub)** and **cultivated (herb)** types.
    
- This is not a contradiction of Day 3 from Genesis 1, but a **contextual limitation to Eden**.
    

**“Had not caused it to rain”**

- Marks the **first mention of rain** in the text.
    
- Suggests a different **pre-Flood hydrological system**, which is supported by the next verse’s “mist” rising from the earth.
    

**“No man to till the ground”**

- “Adam” (אָדָם) here is used generically — no individual yet formed.
    
- Reinforces Eden’s state as **uninhabited and uncultivated** until the divine act of forming man.

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Critics and higher critics often use this verse to attack the internal consistency of Genesis 1 and 2, arguing that the order of events differs.
    
- This is only problematic when read as a **second creation account**, rather than a **zoomed-in narrative continuation**.
    
- The **JEDP theory** exploits this to claim different sources (P vs. J), but the **compound Name YHWH Elohim** here functions as a textual unifier, not a divider.
    
- The LXX’s condensation of shrub and herb distinctions may stem from **translational simplification**, not source variation.

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Anno Mundi 0**, post-Sabbath, just before Adam’s formation.  
This verse sets the conditions of Eden prior to the creation of man, indicating a narrow and specific time window after creation but before human stewardship begins.

---

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV**:  
“And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew: for the Lord God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to till the ground.”

**YLT**:  
“And no shrub of the field is yet in the earth, and no herb of the field doth yet sprout, for Jehovah God hath not rained on the earth, and a man there is not to serve the ground.”

_Both preserve the general meaning, though “before it was in the earth” is better rendered “was not yet” for clarity and tense accuracy._

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

**Jubilees 2:5–8** — Confirms that the Garden of Eden was planted after the creation week. Rain is mentioned as absent; instead, a mist waters the ground.

**Jasher 1:5–6** — Places Adam’s formation from dust immediately following this scene, with God planting Eden as a distinct act.

**1 Enoch** — No direct reference here, but Eden’s geography and function appear later as the habitation of the righteous and the backdrop to the angelic descent.
