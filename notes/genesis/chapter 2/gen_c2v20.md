### **GENESIS 2:20**

_Traditional Genesis 2:23_

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And the man said, “This now is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh. She shall be called Woman, because from man was she taken.”**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וַיֹּאמֶר הָאָדָם  
זֹאת הַפַּעַם  
עֶצֶם מֵעֲצָמַי  
וּבָשָׂר מִבְּשָׂרִי  
לְזֹאת יִקָּרֵא אִשָּׁה  
כִּי מֵאִישׁ לֻקֳחָה־זֹאת

---

#### Transliteration:

_Vayomer ha’adam:  
zot ha’pa’am  
etsem me’atsamai,  
u’vasar mi’vesari;  
le’zot yikkareh ishah,  
ki me’ish lukachah zot._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And Adam said, This now is bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called woman, because she was taken out of her husband.”

_Greek retains the same poetic structure. “Out of her husband” reflects LXX’s interpretive rendering of _ish_ (man)._

---

#### DSS (4QGen-Exoda):

Follows MT exactly — confirms the poetic structure and use of _ishah_ (woman) derived from _ish_ (man).

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“This now…” (זֹאת הַפַּעַם)**

- _Zot ha-pa’am_ = “This time” or “Now at last” — carries a tone of **relief and recognition**.
    
- It implies **previous anticipation** (see Gen 2:17), now resolved.
    

**“Bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh”**

- This is **covenant language** — mirrored later in kinship formulas (e.g., Gen 29:14; 2 Sam 5:1).
    
- Indicates **shared essence**, not just similarity.
    

**“She shall be called Woman (ishah), because from man (ish) she was taken”**

- A Hebrew **wordplay** linking identity and origin.
    
- Woman is not derivative — she is the **completion** of man, not his clone or subordinate.
    
- Naming here affirms unity and mutuality — not superiority.
    

**This is the first recorded human speech in Scripture — and it is poetic, joyful, and full of awe.**

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Some traditions misread this naming as an act of dominance; in Hebrew, it more closely resembles **honor and identification**.
    
- The phrase “from man” (_me’ish_) is often taken to imply hierarchy, but the structure of the text supports **mutual dependence**.
    
- English Bibles often strip this of its poetic rhythm and covenantal gravity — flattening it into prose.

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Anno Mundi 0**, Day 6 — this verse marks **completion** of mankind in full image-bearing form (male and female).

The creation week is nearly complete; rest is imminent.

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.”

**YLT:**  
“And the man saith, ‘This [is] the proper step! bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh! this is called Woman, for from a man hath this been taken;’”

**NIV:**  
“The man said, ‘This is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called “woman,” for she was taken out of man.’”

_YLT’s “proper step” is interpretive and distracting. KJV and NIV align better, though still miss the poetic cadence of the Hebrew._

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

**Jubilees 3:11–12** — directly quotes this event and affirms the creation of marriage.

**Matthew 19:4–5 & Mark 10:6–8** — Yeshua cites this passage as the **foundation of marriage**, highlighting its divine origin and permanence.

**Ephesians 5:28–32** — Paul uses this imagery to teach the mystical union of Messiah and the Assembly — quoting Gen 2:24 as a direct continuation.
