### **GENESIS 2:22**

_Traditional Genesis 2:25_

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And the two of them were naked, the man and his woman, and they were not ashamed.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וַיִּהְיוּ שְׁנֵיהֶם עֲרוּמִּים  
הָאָדָם וְאִשְׁתּוֹ  
וְלֹא יִתְבֹּשָׁשׁוּ

---

#### Transliteration:

_Vayihyu shenehem arummim,  
ha’adam ve’ishto,  
ve’lo yitboshashu._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And the two were naked, both Adam and his wife, and were not ashamed.”

_LXX affirms the dual emphasis and absence of shame._

---

#### DSS (4QGen-Exoda):

Fully consistent with MT. Confirms “two of them” (שְׁנֵיהֶם), “naked” (עֲרוּמִּים), and “not ashamed” (לֹא יִתְבֹּשָׁשׁוּ).

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“They were both naked” (וַיִּהְיוּ שְׁנֵיהֶם עֲרוּמִּים)**

- _Arummim_ = naked, uncovered — without shame, fear, or concealment.
    
- Highlights the **innocence and openness** of the pre-Fall human state.
    
- Also functions as **literary foreshadowing**: in the next chapter, _arum_ (עָרוּם) is used of the serpent’s craftiness — a **wordplay** contrasting innocence and cunning.
    

**“The man and his woman” (הָאָדָם וְאִשְׁתּוֹ)**

- Reinforces the unity described in the previous verse — the two are one in flesh and in presence.
    

**“They were not ashamed” (וְלֹא יִתְבֹּשָׁשׁוּ)**

- Shame enters only after sin (Gen 3:7).
    
- This is the **last moment of unbroken purity** in Scripture — the conclusion of the Edenic ideal.
    

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- The Hebrew wordplay between _arum_ (naked) and _arum_ (crafty) is often ignored or smoothed over, losing the **deliberate contrast** set up between Gen 2:25 and Gen 3:1.
    
- Some theological traditions use this verse to introduce sexual guilt, when the passage clearly emphasizes **innocence, not eroticism**.

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Anno Mundi 0**, conclusion of Day 6 — the final verse before the Fall narrative begins.

This moment represents the **high point of Edenic order**: full union, vulnerability without fear, and communion with Elohim.

---

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.”

**YLT:**  
“And they are both of them naked, the man and his wife, and they are not ashamed of themselves.”

**NIV:**  
“Adam and his wife were both naked, and they felt no shame.”

_NIV introduces “felt no shame” — which is a fair rendering, but the original Hebrew verb is active: “they were not ashamed.”_

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

**Jubilees 3:15–17** — confirms the innocence of Adam and Chavah before the Fall, and that **they were not aware of their nakedness** until after sin.

**1 Enoch 69:11** — indirectly references the introduction of shame and sin via forbidden knowledge, tied to the coming events of chapter 3.
