### **GENESIS 2:19**

_Traditional Genesis 2:22_

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And YHWH Elohim built the side which He had taken from the man into a woman, and He brought her to the man.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וַיִּבֶן יְהוָה אֱלֹהִים  
אֶת־הַצֵּלָע אֲשֶׁר לָקַח מִן־הָאָדָם  
לְאִשָּׁה  
וַיְבִאֶהָ אֶל־הָאָדָם

---

#### Transliteration:

_Vayyiven YHWH Elohim  
et ha’tzela asher lakach min ha’adam  
le’ishah,  
vay’vee’ehah el ha’adam._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And the Lord God formed the rib which He took from Adam into a woman, and brought her to Adam.”

_The Greek verb used for “formed” here (ᾠκοδόμησεν) more literally means **“built”** — consistent with the Hebrew._

---

#### DSS (4QGen-Exoda):

Confirms MT wording exactly — including use of _vayyiven_ (“built”) and _tzelah_ (“side”), not “rib.” Structure is intact.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“Built the side” (וַיִּבֶן אֶת־הַצֵּלָע)**

- _Vayyiven_ = “built, constructed” — used for architectural or **intentional design** (e.g., Gen 8:20; 1 Kgs 6:5).
    
- Woman is not sculpted from dust as Adam was, but **built from pre-existing life** — a separate act of divine craftsmanship.
    
- Emphasizes **purpose, symmetry, and design** — woman is a **constructed counterpart**, not a derivative lesser.
    

**“Into a woman” (לְאִשָּׁה)**

- First use of _ishah_ — from the root _ish_ (man), but distinct.
    
- The naming by Adam (next verse) affirms the linguistic and spiritual unity.
    

**“And He brought her to the man” (וַיְבִאֶהָ אֶל־הָאָדָם)**

- This is the **first divine presentation** — a holy ceremony.
    
- Elohim functions as **the first Father giving away the bride** — the prototype for marriage.
    
- The language implies both **honor and completion** — not servitude.
    

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Translating _tzela_ as "rib" weakens the **symbolic and structural** meaning.
    
- The verb _vayyiven_ (built) is often rendered as “made” or “fashioned,” erasing the **architectural and intentional** implications.
    
- The presentation of the woman is frequently treated as secondary or inferior in theological traditions, rather than a **culminating event**.

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Anno Mundi 0**, Day 6 — final act of creation.

With this event, the image of Elohim — male and female — is **complete**, and the Edenic order is fully established.

---

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man.”

**YLT:**  
“And Jehovah God buildeth up the rib which He hath taken out of the man into a woman, and bringeth her in unto the man.”

**NIV:**  
“Then the LORD God made a woman from the rib he had taken out of the man, and he brought her to the man.”

_YLT preserves “buildeth” — the most faithful to the Hebrew verb. KJV and NIV both lose the architectural connotation._

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

**Jubilees 3:8–11** — emphasizes the building of the woman and the joy Adam experiences upon her arrival, declaring her _bone of his bones_.

**Ecclesiasticus (Sirach) 36:24** — “He that gets a wife begins a possession, a help like unto himself” — echoes the theology of _ezer ke-negdo_.

**Revelation 21:2** — the bride (New Jerusalem) is also “prepared” and “brought down” to meet her bridegroom — mirroring this divine presentation.
