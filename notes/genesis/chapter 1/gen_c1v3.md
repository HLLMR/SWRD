### **GENESIS 1:3**

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic + TR basis):

**And Elohim said, “Let there be light,” and there was light.**

- **Hebrew**: וַיֹּאמֶר אֱלֹהִים יְהִי אוֹר וַיְהִי־אוֹר
    
- **Transliteration**: _Vayomer Elohim, yehi or; vayehi or._

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

#### **“And Elohim said…” (וַיֹּאמֶר אֱלֹהִים)**

- Marks the beginning of divine **creative speech** — each phase of creation from here follows a similar pattern: command → manifestation.
    
- Introduces the concept of **the Word as creative power**. Cross-reference with **John 1:1–3**, which directly connects the Logos (Word) with creation itself.
    
- Notably, this is a **vocalized act** — not formed by hand or tool, but by decree.
    

#### **“Let there be light” (יְהִי אוֹר)**

- **Yehi (יְהִי)**: a _jussive_ form of the verb “to be” — expressing a command or will, not a question or wish.
    
- **Or (אוֹר)**: light — undefined, non-source-specific. This is not sunlight (which comes on Day 4), but **primordial light**, likely tied to divine presence or cosmic order.
    

#### **“And there was light” (וַיְהִי־אוֹר)**

- Immediate fulfillment of command. This demonstrates both **Elohim’s authority** and **the nature of divine speech** — what is spoken becomes reality.
    
- This light is not dependent on celestial bodies — suggesting it may be:
    
    - The **shekinah** (manifest presence of YHWH),
        
    - A **cosmic light principle**,
        
    - Or the **unveiling of time and order** into chaos (cf. Isaiah 45:7 — “I form the light, and create darkness”).

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Post-Nicene interpretations spiritualized or allegorized this “light,” divorcing it from literal chronology.
    
- The Roman Church and Enlightenment-influenced theology distort this verse to **accommodate heliocentrism** or evolutionary cosmology — falsely claiming it supports modern “light burst” events like the Big Bang.
    
- **Kabbalistic Judaism** later mystifies this light as “Ohr Ein Sof” — divorcing it from plain, literal, creative power.

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

- **AM 0, Day 1** — the beginning of **creative time** and **ordered existence**.
    
- This is the **first act** following the Spirit’s movement upon the waters (v.2), signifying the start of measurable chronology.

### 📖 Comparison:

- **KJV**: “And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.”
    
    - Straightforward, though “God” here obscures the specific use of **Elohim**.
        
- **YLT**: “And God saith, ‘Let light be;’ and light is.”
    
    - A more literal reflection of the Hebrew verb forms, though slightly awkward in English.

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

- **2 Enoch 24:2–5** — describes light as the first created element, associated with the throne of Elohim and His countenance.
    
- **Jubilees 2:2** — supports light being created on the first day, before sun, moon, or stars.
    
- Cross-reference with **Revelation 21:23** — the Lamb is the light of New Jerusalem, suggesting this **first light** may have **Messianic or divine-personal dimensions**.
