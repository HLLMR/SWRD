### **GENESIS 1:32-34** (formerly GENESIS 2:1–3)

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**1** Thus the heavens and the earth were completed, and all their array.  
**2** And on the seventh day Elohim completed His work which He had done, and He rested on the seventh day from all His work which He had done.  
**3** And Elohim blessed the seventh day and set it apart, because in it He rested from all His work which Elohim created to make.

- **Hebrew (MT)**:  
    **1** וַיְכֻלּוּ הַשָּׁמַיִם וְהָאָרֶץ וְכָל־צְבָאָם  
    **2** וַיְכַל אֱלֹהִים בַּיּוֹם הַשְּׁבִיעִי מְלַאכְתּוֹ אֲשֶׁר עָשָׂה וַיִּשְׁבֹּת בַּיּוֹם הַשְּׁבִיעִי מִכָּל־מְלַאכְתּוֹ אֲשֶׁר עָשָׂה  
    **3** וַיְבָרֶךְ אֱלֹהִים אֶת־יוֹם הַשְּׁבִיעִי וַיְקַדֵּשׁ אֹתוֹ כִּי בוֹ שָׁבַת מִכָּל־מְלַאכְתּוֹ אֲשֶׁר־בָּרָא אֱלֹהִים לַעֲשׂוֹת
    
- **Transliteration**:  
    **1** _Vay’kullu ha’shamayim ve’ha’aretz ve’khol tzeva’am._  
    **2** _Vay’khal Elohim bayom ha’shevi’i melakhto asher asah; vayishbot bayom ha’shevi’i mikol melakhto asher asah._  
    **3** _Vayevarekh Elohim et yom ha’shevi’i vay’kaddesh oto; ki vo shavat mikol melakhto asher bara Elohim la’asot._
    
- **LXX (Brenton)**:  
    **1** “And the heavens and the earth were finished, and the whole world of them.”  
    **2** “And God finished on the sixth day His works which He made, and ceased on the seventh day from all His works which He made.”  
    **3** “And God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it, because in it He ceased from all His works which God began to do.”
    

> ⚠️ **NOTE**: The LXX says “finished on the sixth day” instead of “seventh” — likely a scribal harmonization. The MT is preferred here.

- **DSS (4QGen-Exoda)**:  
    Supports **Masoretic reading** of **“on the seventh day”** in v.2 — confirming the day on which completion and rest occurred.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

#### **Verse 1 — “Thus the heavens and the earth were completed…”**

- **Vay’kullu** — to be completed, accomplished, brought to full end.
    
- “All their array” (צְבָאָם / _tzeva’am_) — refers to **all their inhabitants, structures, and functions**, including stars, angels, animals, and systems.
    

#### **Verse 2 — “And He rested on the seventh day…”**

- **Shavat (שָׁבַת)** — from the root meaning **“to cease, to rest”**, not out of fatigue but **completion**.
    
- This verse emphasizes:
    
    - **Completion of work**
        
    - **Intentional rest**
        
    - The beginning of a **pattern of sacred time**.
        

> ⚠️ The LXX’s alteration to “sixth day” is likely to avoid theological tension with Exod. 20:11. However, MT + DSS confirm **seventh day rest**, not sixth.

#### **Verse 3 — “And Elohim blessed the seventh day and set it apart…”**

- **Blessed** = endowed with **benefit and favor**.
    
- **Set apart (וַיְקַדֵּשׁ)** = **made holy**, sanctified for a unique purpose.
    
- This is the **first time in Scripture anything is declared “holy.”**
    
    - Not a place. Not a person. But **time** itself.

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- The **Sabbath** is established here, not at Sinai — it is **pre-law, pre-Fall**, and part of **creation itself**.
    
- Rome systematically **rejected seventh-day sanctity**, rebranding it to Sunday in violation of this explicit pattern (cf. Dan. 7:25).
    
- Many churches treat the Sabbath as a **Jewish invention** or legalistic burden — but **Genesis shows it as divine rhythm**, embedded in creation.
    
- Gnostic interpretations downplay this by teaching time itself is corrupt — yet Genesis sets **time apart as holy** before sin ever entered the world.

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

- **AM 0, Day 7** — the work of creation is complete. Elohim **rests, blesses, and hallows** this day.
    
- The foundation of the **weekly cycle** is now established.
    

---

### 📖 Comparison:

- **KJV**: Faithful to MT with "seventh day" repeated; “God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it.”
    
- **YLT**: “God completeth by the seventh day His work… God blesseth the seventh day, and sanctifieth it…”

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

- **Jubilees 2:30–33** — provides one of the **strongest parallel accounts**, emphasizing that the **angels were commanded to keep Sabbath** and that **it was written on heavenly tablets**.
    
- **2 Baruch 57:4–5** — affirms the **Sabbath was always known**, even before Moses.
    
- **Enoch and Jasher** are silent here, but Enoch will echo creation patterns in astronomical calendars later.
