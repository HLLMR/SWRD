### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

#### **“And Elohim blessed them…”**

- **First explicit blessing** in Scripture — **בָּרַךְ (barakh)** denotes:
    
    - A **spoken empowerment**, not just approval.
        
    - A **divine impartation of purpose and increase**.
        
- This is directed **not at humans**, but at **animal life** — a pattern of **fruitfulness built into creation**.
    

#### **“Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas”**

- **Peru u’revu (פְּרוּ וּרְבוּ)** — identical phrase used for mankind in v.28, showing that **the blessing of reproduction is universal**.
    
- **Mil’u et-hamayim ba’yammim** — “fill the waters in the seas”:
    
    - Highlights **dynamic abundance**, not just survival.
        
    - Use of **yammim (seas)** here echoes **“He called them Seas”** in v.10 — reaffirming divine naming and domain structure.
        

#### **“And let the flying creatures multiply in the earth”**

- **Ha‘oph yirev ba’aretz (הָעוֹף יִרֶב בָּאָרֶץ)** — “and let the flying creatures multiply in the earth”:
    
    - Not “on” or “above” the earth — but **within the realm** of land as part of creation’s interactive biosphere.
        
    - Though they fly **on the face of the firmament**, their reproduction and activity are **earth-connected**.

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Many translations dull the significance of this first **blessing** — treating it as a poetic flourish rather than a **foundational act of divine purpose**.
    
- The shift away from **divine command → multiplication by kind** toward **biological randomness** in evolution is a **direct contradiction of this verse**.
    
- Commentaries often treat “blessing” here as **symbolic**, yet Genesis treats blessings as **performative speech acts** — they accomplish what they declare.

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

- **AM 0, Day 5 (near conclusion)** — this is the final divine act of Day 5.
    
- Earth and waters are now **populated with life**, and that life is **empowered to reproduce according to its kind**.

### 📖 Comparison:

- **KJV**: “And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.”
    
    - “Fowl” limits the scope of **‘oph** to birds — not strictly accurate.
        
- **YLT**: “And God blesseth them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and the fowl let multiply in the earth.”
    
    - Preserves structure and poetic cadence.

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

- **Jubilees 2:15** — confirms this blessing: “And He blessed all the things which creep and all that move in the waters… and all the flying things… to increase and multiply.”
    
- **Psalm 104:24–26** — celebrates the teeming sea: “O YHWH, how manifold are thy works… the great and wide sea, wherein are things creeping innumerable… there go the ships: there is that leviathan…”
    
- **1 Enoch 60:7–10** — references Leviathan and Behemoth being **set apart**, but all other life **multiplies within its designated domain**.
