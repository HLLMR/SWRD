### **GENESIS 1:31**

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And Elohim saw all that He had made — and behold, it was very good. And there was evening, and there was morning — the sixth day.**

- **Hebrew (MT)**:  
    וַיַּרְא אֱלֹהִים אֶת־כָּל־אֲשֶׁר עָשָׂה וְהִנֵּה־טוֹב מְאֹד וַיְהִי־עֶרֶב וַיְהִי־בֹקֶר יֹום הַשִּׁשִּׁי
    
- **Transliteration**:  
    _Vayyare Elohim et kol asher asah, ve’hinneh tov me’od; vayehi erev, vayehi boker — yom ha’shishi._
    
- **LXX (Brenton)**:  
    “And God saw all the things that He had made, and behold, they were very good. And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day.”
    
- **DSS (4QGen-Exoda)**:  
    No significant variants — matches MT precisely.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

#### **“And Elohim saw all that He had made”**

- A comprehensive review — not just of Day 6, but of **all six days of creation**.
    
- Reinforces the **intentionality and completeness** of everything made: heavens, earth, life, and man.
    

#### **“Behold, it was very good” (טוֹב מְאֹד)**

- **Tov me’od** = **exceedingly good**, **intensely beautiful**, **wholly fitting**.
    
    - This is the only time **“very good”** is used in the creation narrative.
        
    - It affirms that **nothing is out of order**, **no sin**, **no death**, **no decay**, and **no rebellion** yet.
        
- Some rabbinic interpretations suggest this marks the inclusion of **man and woman** — the creation is not merely good until **man is present as steward**.
    

#### **“There was evening and there was morning — the sixth day”**

- The phrase **yom ha’shishi (יוֹם הַשִּׁשִּׁי)** includes the **definite article “the”**, unlike the earlier day counts (e.g., "day one," "a second day").
    
    - This marks **finality** and **culmination**.
        
    - It prepares us for **Sabbath rest** in Chapter 2.

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Many theological systems treat Eden as myth or metaphor — this verse emphatically confirms that creation was **literal, ordered, and very good**.
    
- Evolutionary and deep-time models **require death before sin**, but this verse contradicts that by declaring a world **completely good** before the Fall.
    
- Gnostic traditions often portray creation as flawed or corrupted — but **Genesis affirms creation as divinely perfect** until corrupted by man’s rebellion (Gen 3).

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

- **AM 0, end of Day 6** — the full creation cycle is complete.
    
- All realms — heavens, earth, sea, animal kingdom, and mankind — are in harmony.
    
- The next act is **Sabbath rest**, establishing a pattern for holy time.

### 📖 Comparison:

- **KJV**: “And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.”
    
    - Accurate and well-phrased.
        
- **YLT**: “And God seeth all that He hath made, and lo, very good; and there is an evening, and there is a morning — day the sixth.”
    
    - Reflects the definite article “the sixth” well.

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

- **Jubilees 2:29–30** — explicitly confirms the **six-day structure** and declares **Sabbath holiness** in the next chapter.
    
- **2 Esdras 6:38–39** — echoes the six-day creation and culminates in the creation of man as the crowning act.
    
- **Jasher and Enoch** do not add detail to this closing but will enter again post-Fall or post-Sabbath.
