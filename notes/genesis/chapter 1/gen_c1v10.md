### **GENESIS 1:10**

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And Elohim called the dry land Earth, and the gathering together of the waters He called Seas; and Elohim saw that it was good.**

- **Hebrew (MT)**: וַיִּקְרָא אֱלֹהִים לַיַּבָּשָׁה אֶרֶץ וּלְמִקְוֵה הַמַּיִם קָרָא יַמִּים וַיַּרְא אֱלֹהִים כִּי־טוֹב
    
- **Transliteration**: _Vayyiqra Elohim la-yabashah eretz, ulemiqveh hamayim qara yamim; vayyar Elohim ki tov._
    
- **LXX (Brenton)**: “And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering of the waters he called Seas: and God saw that it was good.”
    
- **DSS (4QGen-Exoda)**: Fully aligns with the Masoretic in this verse; no meaningful textual deviation.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

#### **“And Elohim called the dry land Earth...”**

- Naming again conveys **ownership and dominion**.
    
- **Eretz (אֶרֶץ)** — now specifically applied to **the visible, habitable dry land**, not to the entire planet or cosmos.
    
    - Same word is used later for “land of Canaan,” “land of Egypt,” and more — so it’s **context-dependent**, not a term for a globe.
        

#### **“And the gathering of the waters He called Seas...”**

- **Miqveh hamayim (מִקְוֵה הַמַּיִם)** — “gathering-place of the waters” is a poetic, technical term, used again in **Leviticus 11:36** for a **body of collected water** (a mikveh).
    
- **Yamim (יַמִּים)** — “seas” plural, acknowledging **multiple water regions** despite earlier mention of “one place” (v.9). This implies **interconnected basins**, not a flat uniform lake.
    

#### **“And Elohim saw that it was good.”**

- First **“good”** declaration since **day one** (v.4) — day two lacked it, likely because division of waters was **incomplete** until now.
    
- **Tov (טוֹב)** here reflects **functional readiness** — land and sea are now correctly distinguished and named.

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Catholic and post-Enlightenment theology downplay the significance of divine naming, favoring **natural processes** (erosion, tectonics, etc.) over the **instantaneous creative acts** described.
    
- Liberal scholarship tends to treat this as **mythopoetic** or **symbolic**, despite the text’s unambiguous, direct language.
    
- The word **“Earth”** has been retrofitted into a modern planetary model — but here it refers to **the revealed dry land** under the firmament, not a spinning globe.

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

- **AM 0, Day 3 (midpoint)** — dry land and seas now exist in distinction.
    
- Prepares the stage for **vegetation**, which follows in the next verses — **function precedes filling**, a structural theme throughout Genesis 1.

### 📖 Comparison:

- **KJV**: “And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.”
    
    - Retains most of the original meaning.
        
- **YLT**: “And God calleth to the dry land ‘Earth,’ and to the collection of the waters He hath called ‘Seas;’ and God seeth that it is good.”
    
    - Clunky, but captures the Hebrew sense of _calling_.

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

- **Jubilees 2:6** — confirms this sequence: “And He called the dry land Earth, and the midst of the water He called Seas.”
    
- **Psalm 104:5–9** — poetic parallel to this verse: “Thou coveredst it with the deep as with a garment... the waters stood above the mountains... Thou hast set a bound that they may not pass.”
    
- **1 Enoch 77:1–4** — lists the seven great rivers and seas under Heaven, aligning with the concept of **named, structured aquatic regions**.
