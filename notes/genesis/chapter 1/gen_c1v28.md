### **GENESIS 1:28**

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And Elohim blessed them. And Elohim said to them, “Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth, and subdue it. And rule over the fish of the sea, and over the flying creatures of the heavens, and over every living creature that moves upon the earth.”**

- **Hebrew (MT)**:  
    וַיְבָרֶךְ אֹתָם אֱלֹהִים וַיֹּאמֶר לָהֶם אֱלֹהִים פְּרוּ וּרְבוּ וּמִלְאוּ אֶת־הָאָרֶץ וְכִבְשֻׁהָ וּרְדוּ בִּדְגַת הַיָּם וּבְעוֹף הַשָּׁמַיִם וּבְכָל־חַיָּה הָרֹמֶשֶׂת עַל־הָאָרֶץ
    
- **Transliteration**:  
    _Vayevarekh otam Elohim, vayomer lahem Elohim: peru u’revu, u’mil’u et ha’aretz, v’kivshuhah; ur’du vidgat hayam, uve‘oph hashamayim, uve’khol chayyah haromeset al ha’aretz._
    
- **LXX (Brenton)**:  
    “And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth and subdue it, and have dominion over the fish of the seas and the flying things of the heaven, and all the cattle and all the earth and all the reptiles that creep on the earth.”
    
- **DSS (4QGen-Exoda)**:  
    No variant in this verse; text matches Masoretic fully.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

#### **“And Elohim blessed them…”**

- This is the **second blessing** in creation — the first was to sea and flying creatures (v.22), but this one is **unique**:
    
    - Directed at **mankind**.
        
    - Followed by a **spoken commission**.
        
- Blessing is not just approval — it’s a **delegation of power** and **purpose**.
    

#### **“Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the earth…”**

- **Peru u’revu u’mil’u (פְּרוּ וּרְבוּ וּמִלְאוּ)** — reproductive fruitfulness is not optional; it is **foundational to the human mandate**.
    
- This command is **procreative and expansive** — designed to **populate and steward** the whole Earth.
    

#### **“And subdue it” (וְכִבְשֻׁהָ)**

- Hebrew **kavash (כָּבַשׁ)** = to bring into subjection, to **tame, harness, or govern**.
    
    - Not violent conquest — but **establishing order over creation**.
        
    - The world is **good** but **not yet cultivated** — man is called to **complete the work** through wise rulership.
        

#### **“And rule over…” (וּרְדוּ)**

- From **radah (רָדָה)** — same root as v.26.
    
    - Denotes active governance, responsibility, and stewardship — not passivity.
        
- The objects of dominion:
    
    1. **Fish of the sea**
        
    2. **Flying creatures of the heavens**
        
    3. **Every living creature that moves on the earth** — includes livestock, wild animals, and creeping things.
        

> ⚠️ Note: Though man is given dominion, **no mention is made of eating animals** — that permission comes **after the Fall** (Gen 9:3). Dominion here is **governance**, not predation.

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Many translations downplay **“subdue”** and **“rule”** as though dominion is harsh or oppressive — but the biblical framework is that man **rules as a vice-regent of Elohim**, reflecting His order and justice.
    
- Some traditions treat this as a **cultural or farming metaphor** — ignoring its full scope over **biosphere, environment, and creation order**.
    
- Liberal theology often suggests humanity is merely **one part of nature**, but this verse clearly gives man **a unique and superior role**.
    

---

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

- **AM 0, Day 6 (late)** — mankind is blessed and commissioned **immediately upon creation**.
    
- This marks the transition from **physical formation** to **vocational identity** — man is not just made **in the image**, but **for a mission**.
    

---

### 📖 Comparison:

- **KJV**: “And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it…”
    
    - “Replenish” is misleading — Hebrew _mil’u_ means “fill,” not “refill.”
        
- **YLT**: “And God blesseth them, and God saith to them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the earth, and subdue it…”
    
    - Faithful and direct — good rendering of command structure.

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

- **Jubilees 2:21–23** — confirms this commission and adds that **Elohim placed Adam in Eden** afterward.
    
- **Book of Jasher 1:2–3** — describes man’s body being formed, and Adam standing and naming the animals — good material to interleave with Gen 2.
    
- **1 Enoch** begins to reflect on mankind’s dominion and fall in later chapters, but does not interleave directly at this stage.
