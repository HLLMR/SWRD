### **GENESIS 1:7**

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And Elohim made the firmament, and He divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament; and it was so.**

- **Hebrew (MT)**: וַיַּעַשׂ אֱלֹהִים אֶת־הָרָקִיעַ וַיַּבְדֵּל בֵּין הַמַּיִם אֲשֶׁר מִתַּחַת לָרָקִיעַ וּבֵין הַמַּיִם אֲשֶׁר מֵעַל לָרָקִיעַ וַיְהִי־כֵן
    
- **Transliteration**: _Vayya’as Elohim et ha-raqia, vayyavdel bein ha-mayim asher mitachat la-raqia, uvein ha-mayim asher me’al la-raqia; vayehi ken._
    
- **LXX (Brenton)**: “And God made the firmament, and God divided between the water which was under the firmament and the water which was above the firmament: and it was so.”
    
- **DSS (4QGen-Exoda)**: Fragmentary but consistent with MT on this verse; no known variant affecting meaning.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

#### **"And Elohim made the firmament..."**

- The word **“made” (וַיַּעַשׂ)** follows **“let there be”** from verse 6, showing that **divine command is followed by action**.
    
- **Raqia** remains central — a solid expanse now **functionally established** as a divider.
    

#### **"Divided the waters... under and above..."**

- Reinforces **vertical cosmology** — with **waters above** _and_ **waters below**, separated by a firm, fixed boundary.
    
- There is **no mention of evaporation, condensation, or meteorology** — this is **a permanent cosmic structure**, not symbolic or meteorological.
    
- This verse destroys modern models that eliminate **upper waters** entirely.
    

#### **"And it was so" (וַיְהִי־כֵן)**

- Formulaic affirmation — the act was completed **exactly as spoken**. Used throughout Genesis 1 to mark successful execution of the command.

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Post-Reformation and Enlightenment theologians gradually **abandoned the firmament doctrine**, replacing it with “atmosphere” or “expanse” in violation of both text and tradition.
    
- Catholic and Protestant commentators post-1600s downplayed **upper waters**, despite continued attestation in **Psalms (148:4)** and **2 Peter 3:5**.
    
- LXX and early Church Fathers (pre-Nicene) upheld **literal firmament structure** — only later allegorized.

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

- **AM 0, Day 2 continues and concludes** — the spatial ordering of creation is completed. No land, sun, or stars yet, but the **structural cosmos is now layered**.

### 📖 Comparison:

- **KJV**: “And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.”
    
    - Retains “firmament,” but suffers from modern misunderstanding of the term.
        
- **YLT**: “And God maketh the expanse, and it separateth between the waters which are under the expanse, and the waters which are above the expanse: and it is so.”
    
    - Faithful to Hebrew verb form but **"expanse"** weakens the literal solidity implied by _raqia_.

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

- **Jubilees 2:4** — confirms this structure: “On the second day He created the firmament…and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament.”
    
- **1 Enoch 89:2** describes the creation of the heaven "above the earth," corresponding with this division.
    
- **Psalm 148:4** — still references “waters that are above the heavens,” proving they were not removed in the Flood.
    
- **2 Peter 3:5** — affirms the **earth standing out of the water and in the water**, by the word of Elohim — confirming continuity with Genesis 1 cosmology.
