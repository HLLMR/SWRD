#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And Elohim said, “Let the waters swarm with swarming living creatures, and let flying creatures fly above the earth across the face of the firmament of the heavens.”**

- **Hebrew (MT)**: וַיֹּאמֶר אֱלֹהִים יִשְׁרְצוּ הַמַּיִם שֶׁרֶץ נֶפֶשׁ חַיָּה וְעוֹף יְעוֹפֵף עַל־הָאָרֶץ עַל־פְּנֵי רְקִיעַ הַשָּׁמָיִם
    
- **Transliteration**: _Vayomer Elohim, yishretzu hamayim sheretz nefesh chayyah, ve’oph ye’ofef al ha’aretz al penei reqia hashamayim._
    
- **LXX (Brenton)**: “And God said, Let the waters bring forth reptiles having life, and winged creatures flying above the earth in the firmament of the heaven.”
    
- **DSS (4QGen-Exoda)**: No deviation in this verse; confirms MT structure.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

#### **“Let the waters swarm with swarming living creatures”**

- **Yishretzu (יִשְׁרְצוּ)** — verb meaning “to teem,” “swarm,” or “creep abundantly.” From the root _sh-r-ts_, also used in Leviticus for creeping things.
    
- **Sheretz nefesh chayyah** — “swarming thing of living soul” — emphasizes that **life originates in the waters** by direct divine command.
    
- This includes **fish**, but also a wide range of aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms — not limited to modern taxonomy.
    

#### **“And let flying creatures fly above the earth”**

- **‘Oph ye’ofef (עוֹף יְעוֹפֵף)** — “flying flying-thing” (intensified verb + noun). Includes **birds**, but not restricted to feathered creatures — possibly includes flying insects or even winged reptiles.
    
- No evolutionary progression implied — **flight is granted instantly**, without transitional forms.
    

#### **“Across the face of the firmament of the heavens”**

- **Al penei reqia hashamayim** — literally, “upon the face of the firmament of the heavens.”
    
    - Flying creatures operate **within or upon the lower surface** of the firmament — reinforcing that the **firmament is a fixed structure**, not an abstraction.
        
    - This also implicitly locates **atmosphere below the raqia**, not synonymous with it.
        
- The heavens remain the **domain within the firmament** — birds do not fly “in space,” but on the **face** of this created dome.

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- “Firmament” often softened to “sky” or “air” in modern Bibles, dissolving the physical cosmology into vague abstraction.
    
- Many theological models attempt to align this with evolutionary biology — e.g., fish to amphibian to bird — but Genesis gives **no sequence of transformation**, only immediate creation by kind.
    
- Church Fathers (pre-Nicene) and ancient Jewish texts affirm **instantaneous, fiat creation** — later allegorization emerged under Greek philosophical influence.

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

- **AM 0, Day 5 begins** — the first creation of **animal life**, after the structured creation of land, sea, and vegetation.
    
- Life begins in **water** and **air**, not on land — consistent with **Jubilees** and **1 Enoch** cosmological sequences.

### 📖 Comparison:

- **KJV**: “And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven.”
    
    - “Open firmament” is interpretive and not in Hebrew — adds unnecessary nuance.
        
- **YLT**: “Let the waters teem [with] the teeming living creature, and fowl fly above the earth on the face of the expanse of the heavens.”
    
    - More faithful to Hebrew idiom, though still uses “expanse.”

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

- **Jubilees 2:13–14** — states: “On the fifth day He created great sea monsters in the depths of the waters… and all flying birds… male and female.”
    
- **1 Enoch 60:7–8** — speaks of the Leviathan and Behemoth, suggesting that **some great creatures of the waters** were distinct, set apart for judgment — may tie to v.21.
    
- **Psalm 148:7–10** — praises “sea monsters and all deeps… flying fowl” — echoes Day 5’s creative acts.
