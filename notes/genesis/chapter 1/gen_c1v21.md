### **GENESIS 1:21**

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And Elohim created the great sea creatures, and every living creature that moves, with which the waters swarmed, according to their kinds, and every winged flying creature according to its kind; and Elohim saw that it was good.**

- **Hebrew (MT)**: וַיִּבְרָא אֱלֹהִים אֶת־הַתַּנִּינִם הַגְּדֹלִים וְאֵת כָּל־נֶפֶשׁ הַחַיָּה הָרֹמֶשֶׂת אֲשֶׁר שָׁרְצוּ הַמַּיִם לְמִינֵהֶם וְאֵת כָּל־עוֹף כָּנָף לְמִינֵהוּ וַיַּרְא אֱלֹהִים כִּי־טוֹב
    
- **Transliteration**: _Vayyivra Elohim et hatanninim hagedolim, ve’et kol-nefesh hachayyah haromeset asher shar’tzu hamayim le’minehem, ve’et kol-‘oph kanaf le’minehu; vayyare Elohim ki-tov._
    
- **LXX (Brenton)**: “And God made great whales, and every living creature that moves, which the waters brought forth according to their kinds, and every winged bird according to its kind: and God saw that it was good.”
    
- **DSS (4QGen-Exoda)**: Fully aligned with MT; no known variation in this verse.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

#### **“And Elohim created the great sea creatures”**

- **Tanninim hagedolim (הַתַּנִּינִם הַגְּדֹלִים)** — often rendered “great whales” or “sea monsters.”
    
    - **Tanninim** is used throughout Scripture to refer to **large aquatic or reptilian beasts**, sometimes serpentine or dragon-like (cf. Exodus 7:9–10; Isaiah 27:1; Job 7:12).
        
    - These may include **extinct marine reptiles (e.g., plesiosaurs)** or **mythologized creatures** with real-world counterparts.
        
- The text does **not** say “God made fish and then whales evolved” — **He created these large, fearsome beings directly and distinctly**.
    

#### **“And every living creature that moves, with which the waters swarmed…”**

- **Nefesh hachayyah haromeset** — “moving living soul/being”
    
    - Includes all **mobile aquatic life**, not just large creatures — from fish to microscopic swarming life.
        
- **Asher shar’tzu hamayim** — the waters **teemed** or **brought forth in abundance**, in fulfillment of v.20.
    
    - Not a naturalistic process — but an act of divine command, instantly producing life **by kind**.
        

#### **“And every winged flying creature according to its kind”**

- **‘Oph kanaf** — “flying winged creature”
    
    - Redundant phrasing for emphasis — a Hebrew idiom for **fully airborne beings**.
        
    - Reinforces that this includes **all kinds of flying animals**, not just birds — insects and possible extinct flyers as well.
        
- **Le’minehu** — again, “according to its kind” — emphasizing the **genetic boundaries** God placed on creation.
    

#### **“And Elohim saw that it was good”**

- Declares that the entire domain of **marine and airborne life** was not only completed but **functionally perfect**.
    
- No struggle, predation, or death — that comes later. This is **pre-Fall creation**, in a state of **shalom and order**.

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Some modern Bibles translate **tanninim** as “whales” or “sea creatures” to **de-mythologize** the text — despite clear Scriptural use of **tannin** for **dragon-like entities**.
    
- The evolutionary model reads **“the waters brought forth”** (LXX) as **a natural emergence**, but Hebrew grammar makes clear that **God is the agent** of this abundance.
    
- The phrase **“after its kind”** is systematically downplayed in evolutionary theology, despite being a **central structural theme** in Genesis 1.

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

- **AM 0, Day 5 (continued)** — creation of all **sea life** and **flying life**.
    
- Reaches peak biological diversity thus far in the creation week — preparing Earth for land creatures and mankind.

### 📖 Comparison:

- **KJV**: “And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly…”
    
    - Uses “whales” for **tanninim**, which is interpretive and diminishes the scale and potential terror of the creatures.
        
- **YLT**: “And God prepareth the great monsters, and every living creature that is creeping, which the waters have teemed with…”
    
    - “Monsters” is closer to the intent of **tanninim** than “whales.”

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

- **Jubilees 2:13–14** — “And He created great sea monsters in the depths of the waters…and all flying birds.”
    
    - Omits insects, and gives special mention to the “great sea monsters,” aligning with **tanninim**.
        
- **1 Enoch 60:7–9** — mentions **Leviathan** and **Behemoth** as **pre-Flood creatures set apart**, possibly linked to tanninim.
    
- **Job 41** (Leviathan) and **Isaiah 27:1** — describe sea monsters with power and autonomy, sometimes symbolic of empires, but based in real-world fearsome creatures.
