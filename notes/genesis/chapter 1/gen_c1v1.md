### **GENESIS 1:1**

#### 📜 Literal Translation (from Masoretic + TR basis):

**In the beginning, Elohim created the heavens and the earth.**

- **Hebrew**: בְּרֵאשִׁית בָּרָא אֱלֹהִים אֵת הַשָּׁמַיִם וְאֵת הָאָרֶץ
    
- **Transliteration**: _Bereshith bara Elohim et hashamayim ve’et ha’aretz_

#### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

- **"Elohim"** (plural form): Grammatically plural, but paired with singular verb "bara" — a deliberate theological marker. Suggests plurality within unity (hinted at in John 1:1 and Proverbs 8).
    
- **"In the beginning"**: The Hebrew **בְּרֵאשִׁית** lacks a definite article — more literally, “In beginning…” This could suggest a _foundational act_ rather than a specific moment in time.
    
- **"Heavens and earth"**: A merism, encompassing all of created space/matter — not merely atmosphere and land.

#### 🔍 Ambiguities / Institutional Editorial Influence:

- **Septuagint** and later Church Fathers heavily allegorized this verse. Avoid such interpretations unless tied to direct Scripture (e.g., John 1).
    
- The influence of Hellenized cosmology has obscured the original Hebrew cosmological model (firmament, waters above, immovable Earth).

#### 🕰️ Anno Mundi (AM) Estimate:

- **AM 0** — The creation of space, time, matter.
    
- Interleave potential: **Jubilees 2:1** begins recounting creation in the first week. **Enoch 1** also begins with pre-Flood revelations, but not directly tied to creation.

#### 📖 Comparison:

- **KJV**: “In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.”
    
    - Uses singular “heaven” — poor translation of plural _shamayim_.
        
- **YLT**: “In the beginning of God’s preparing the heavens and the earth—”
    
    - Captures Hebrew aspectual nuance but awkwardly phrased.

#### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunity:

- **Jubilees 2:2–3** adds structure: “And on the first day He created the heavens above and the earth, the waters, and all the spirits who serve before Him...”
    
- This implies angelic creation also occurred on **Day 1**, which aligns with Job 38:7 ("when the morning stars sang together").
