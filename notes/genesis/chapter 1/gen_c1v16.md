### **GENESIS 1:16**

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And Elohim made the two great lights — the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night — and the stars also.**

- **Hebrew (MT)**: וַיַּעַשׂ אֱלֹהִים אֶת־שְׁנֵי הַמְּאֹרוֹת הַגְּדֹלִים אֶת־הַמָּאוֹר הַגָּדוֹל לְמֶמְשֶׁלֶת הַיּוֹם וְאֶת־הַמָּאוֹר הַקָּטֹן לְמֶמְשֶׁלֶת הַלַּיְלָה וְאֵת הַכּוֹכָבִים
    
- **Transliteration**: _Vayya’as Elohim et shenei hame’orot hagedolim, et hama’or hagadol lememshelet hayom, ve’et hama’or hakaton lememshelet halailah, ve’et hakochavim._
    
- **LXX (Brenton)**: “And God made the two great lights: the greater light for regulating the day, and the lesser light for regulating the night: and the stars also.”
    
- **DSS (4QGen-Exoda)**: Agrees with MT; no variant of note here.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

#### **“And Elohim made the two great lights”**

- **Me’orot hagedolim** — plural, “great light-bearers.” The word **“made” (וַיַּעַשׂ)** here implies **formation**, not invention — their **existence as lights** is defined by their assigned role.
    
- There is no contradiction with **“let there be lights…”** (v.14); this verse now **specifies** which lights are being installed in the firmament.
    

#### **“The greater light to rule the day”**

- **Ma’or hagadol** — clearly refers to the **sun**, though never named here. Instead, it’s defined by its **function**: **to rule the day**.
    
- **Memshelet (מֶמְשֶׁלֶת)** — implies **dominion or governance**, not just illumination. The sun **governs** the day — a term loaded with **cosmic order**, not physics.
    

#### **“The lesser light to rule the night”**

- **Ma’or hakaton** — the **moon**, again unnamed, yet given **rulership over night**. Its glory is “lesser,” but its authority is parallel.
    
- Avoids pagan naming and personification — neither sun nor moon are called by name to resist idolatrous tendencies (cf. Deut. 4:19).
    

#### **“And the stars also” (וְאֵת הַכּוֹכָבִים)**

- Almost an afterthought in form — but **deliberate in function**.
    
- **Kochavim** = stars, including planets and wandering stars (in ancient categorization).
    
- Implies all **celestial luminaries** besides sun and moon are also **placed inside the firmament** and serve a subordinate role in timekeeping and signs (see v.14).

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Heliocentric and secular cosmology places stars **billions of light-years away**, not “in the firmament.”
    
- Many theologies **downplay the order and rulership** of the sun and moon, treating them as incidental byproducts of natural processes — not **divinely appointed governors**.
    
- Pagan and Roman systems **named** the sun, moon, and planets after gods (Sol, Luna, Saturn, etc.) — a practice Genesis **explicitly avoids**.

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

- **AM 0, Day 4 (continued)** — now in the specification phase after the general decree of v.14–15.
    
- The lights are now **defined in rank, function, and realm**, not just existence.

### 📖 Comparison:

- **KJV**: “And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.”
    
    - Slightly awkward — “he made the stars also” implies a separate act, which is not in the Hebrew structure.
        
- **YLT**: “And God maketh the two great luminaries — the great luminary for the rule of the day, and the small luminary for the rule of the night — and the stars.”
    
    - Better preservation of syntax and phrase structure.

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

- **Jubilees 2:10–11** — confirms this functional language: “the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night… and the stars also.”
    
- **1 Enoch 72–75** — the **Book of Luminaries** gives detailed observational instructions for **solar, lunar, and star cycles** — all tied to the **mo’edim** (appointed times).
    
- **Psalm 136:7–9** — “To Him that made great lights… the sun to rule by day… the moon and stars to rule by night…”
