### **GENESIS 1:30**

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**“And to every beast of the earth, and to every flying creature of the heavens, and to every creeping thing on the earth in which is a living soul — I have given every green plant for food.” And it was so.**

- **Hebrew (MT)**:  
    וּלְכָל־חַיַּת הָאָרֶץ וּלְכָל־עוֹף הַשָּׁמַיִם וּלְכֹל רוֹמֵשׂ עַל־הָאָרֶץ אֲשֶׁר־בּוֹ נֶפֶשׁ חַיָּה אֶת־כָּל־יֶרֶק עֵשֶׂב לְאָכְלָה וַיְהִי־כֵן
    
- **Transliteration**:  
    _Ul’khol chayyat ha’aretz, ul’khol ‘oph hashamayim, ul’khol romes al ha’aretz asher bo nefesh chayyah — et kol yereq ‘esev le’ochlah. Vayehi ken._
    
- **LXX (Brenton)**:  
    “And to all the wild beasts of the earth, and to all the birds of the sky, and to every reptile creeping on the earth which has in it the breath of life, I have given every green plant for food.” And it was so.
    
- **DSS (4QGen-Exoda)**:  
    Identical to MT — no known variations in this verse.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

#### **“To every beast… every flying creature… every creeping thing…”**

- This mirrors the **tripartite land-animal taxonomy** of Gen 1:24–25.
    
    - Emphasis: **all breathing land and air animals**.
        
    - Hebrew includes the clause **“in which is a living soul” (נֶפֶשׁ חַיָּה / nefesh chayyah)** — indicates **sentient life**, not microbes or plants.
        

#### **“I have given every green plant for food”**

- **Yereq ‘esev (יֶרֶק עֵשֶׂב)** = “green plant” or “green herb”
    
    - Specifically refers to **vegetative, non-fruiting plants** — grasses, leaves, tender shoots.
        
    - This **contrasts with mankind’s seed-bearing diet** in v.29.
        
- Animals are granted a **plant-only diet** — no predation or carnivory implied.
    
    - This defines Eden as a **non-violent, peaceable creation**, later disrupted by sin (cf. Gen 9:3, Isa. 11:6–9).
        

#### **“And it was so”**

- Final affirmation of the **pre-Fall ecosystem** — harmonious, sustainable, and vegetarian for all breathing life.

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- This passage is often **ignored in creationist circles** defending carnivory before the Fall — but **Scripture is explicit** that both man and animals ate **only plants** at this time.
    
- Evolutionary frameworks depend on **millions of years of bloodshed** — this Edenic vision **denies death, blood, or violence before sin**.
    
- Catholic and many Protestant traditions institutionalize animal sacrifice **without clear distinction between Eden and post-Fall systems** — but this verse underscores the **original peace** before sin entered the world.

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

- **AM 0, late Day 6** — ecosystem is fully functional; food chain established, and **death is absent** from all sentient life.
    
- This is the last preparatory act before Elohim completes creation with rest.

### 📖 Comparison:

- **KJV**: “And to every beast… I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.”
    
    - “Meat” again means “food,” but is confusing in modern English.
        
- **YLT**: “And to every beast… I have given every green herb for food: and it is so.”
    
    - Clean and faithful.

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

- **Jubilees 2:21–23** — affirms that animals were given plants to eat.
    
- **1 Enoch 7:5** — after the Fall, Watchers teach men to eat flesh and drink blood — implying this original order was **subverted**.
    
- **Isaiah 11:6–9** (prophetic echo) — describes a restored Edenic world where **lion eats straw like the ox**, and violence is no more.
