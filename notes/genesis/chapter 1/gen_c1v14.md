### **GENESIS 1:14**

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And Elohim said, “Let there be lights in the firmament of the heavens to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for appointed times, and for days, and years.”**

- **Hebrew (MT)**: וַיֹּאמֶר אֱלֹהִים יְהִי מְאֹרֹת בִּרְקִיעַ הַשָּׁמַיִם לְהַבְדִּיל בֵּין הַיּוֹם וּבֵין הַלַּיְלָה וְהָיוּ לְאֹתוֹת וּלְמוֹעֲדִים וּלְיָמִים וְשָׁנִים
    
- **Transliteration**: _Vayomer Elohim, yehi me’orot birqia hashamayim, lehavdil bein hayom uvein halailah; vehayu le’otot, ulemo’adim, uleyamim, veshanim._
    
- **LXX (Brenton)**: “And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth, to divide between the day and the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and for years.”
    
- **DSS**: Matches MT for this verse; 4QGen-Exoda supports the same phrasing.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

#### **“Let there be lights (מְאֹרֹת / me’orot)”**

- Plural form of **ma’or**, meaning **light-bearers** or **luminaries** — **not** light itself (_or_, v.3), but **objects that emit or reflect light**.
    
- This is the **first mention of light sources**, distinct from the original light (v.3), which had **no physical source specified**.
    

#### **“In the firmament of the heavens” (בִּרְקִיעַ הַשָּׁמַיִם)**

- These lights are placed **within the firmament**, not beyond or abstractly in "space."
    
- Reinforces the ancient **enclosed cosmology** — **sun, moon, and stars are inside the dome**, not in an infinite void.
    
- “Firmament of the heavens” = **raqia** named **shamayim** in v.8 — same structure.
    

#### **“To divide the day from the night”**

- **Function**: timekeeping through **observable separation** of light phases.
    
- Light and darkness were already divided (v.4), but now **celestial markers** are appointed to **display** that division.
    

#### **“And let them be for signs (אֹתוֹת), appointed times (מוֹעֲדִים), days (יָמִים), and years (שָׁנִים)”**

- **Ototh (signs)** — signals, warnings, or appointed revelations. Used throughout Torah and prophets for both **celestial omens** and **sacred indicators**.
    
- **Mo’adim (appointed times)** — refers to **festivals, Sabbaths, and sacred appointments**. Same word used for feasts in Leviticus 23.
    
- **Yamim / Shanim (days / years)** — establishes a literal **calendar system**.
    
- This verse defines the **purpose of the heavenly bodies** — **not** for navigation or scientific inquiry, but for **sacred timekeeping and testimony**.

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Heliocentric cosmology removes celestial bodies from the **firmament**, placing them in limitless space — in direct contradiction to this verse.
    
- Modern translations often render **“firmament”** as “expanse” or “sky,” obscuring the **structured placement** of these lights **within a bounded domain**.
    
- Many commentaries ignore or suppress the link between celestial bodies and **God’s feast calendar**, despite clear repetition in Exodus, Leviticus, and Jubilees.
    

---

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

- **AM 0, Day 4 begins** — first appearance of **astronomical lights**, though time (evening and morning) already existed via divine light (v.3).
    
- These luminaries now **mark and regulate** the time that has already been functioning — they **do not initiate it**.
    

---

### 📖 Comparison:

- **KJV**: “And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night…”
    
    - Preserves “firmament,” but uses singular “heaven.”
        
- **YLT**: “Let luminaries be in the expanse of the heavens, to make a separation between the day and the night…”
    
    - Uses “expanse,” which weakens the solidity of _raqia_.

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

- **Jubilees 2:9–10** — confirms that lights were created to “divide the day from the night, and to be signs for seasons and for days and for years and for Sabbaths.”
    
- **1 Enoch 72–75 (Book of Luminaries)** — gives detailed schematics for how sun and moon govern **mo’adim** (appointed times).
    
- **Psalm 104:19** — “He appointed the moon for seasons: the sun knoweth his going down.” Same purpose echoed.
