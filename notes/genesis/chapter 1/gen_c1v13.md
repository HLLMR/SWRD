#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And there was evening, and there was morning — the third day.**

- **Hebrew (MT)**: וַיְהִי־עֶרֶב וַיְהִי־בֹקֶר יוֹם שְׁלִישִׁי
    
- **Transliteration**: _Vayehi erev, vayehi boker — yom shelishi._
    
- **LXX (Brenton)**: “And there was evening and there was morning, the third day.”
    
- **DSS (4QGen-Exoda)**: No variant; text consistent with MT.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

#### **“And there was evening, and there was morning…”**

- Continues the **Hebrew day structure**: the day **begins at sunset**, not midnight or dawn.
    
- Reinforces **cyclical, observable time** established before the creation of celestial timekeepers (which comes on Day 4).
    
- Marks the **closure** of the third day’s creative acts — land division and vegetation.
    

#### **“The third day” (יוֹם שְׁלִישִׁי)**

- First use of **“shelishi”** — the Hebrew ordinal for “third.”
    
- Signals both **sequential order** and **completeness of a phase**. Each day builds a distinct layer of functional structure within creation.

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Some modern commentaries avoid using this verse to anchor literal days, favoring poetic or allegorical readings — but the repetitive structure is **deliberately historical and ordered**.
    
- The notion of “evening and morning” being metaphorical is alien to both **Hebrew idiom** and **ancient Jewish understanding**.
    
- Calendar reform (e.g., Roman midnight-based days) has obscured the original **sunset-to-sunset** reckoning, but Genesis preserves it as the **divinely established template**.

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

- **AM 0, Day 3 ends** — the Earth is now:
    
    - Shaped (land and sea),
        
    - Named (earth and seas),
        
    - Seeded (plants and trees),
        
    - Functionally complete for habitation.

### 📖 Comparison:

- **KJV**: “And the evening and the morning were the third day.”
    
    - Reverses Hebrew order slightly (“the evening and the morning”) — stylistic, not substantive.
        
- **YLT**: “And there is an evening, and there is a morning — day third.”
    
    - Captures Hebrew rhythm, though phrasing is stilted.

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

- **Jubilees 2:9–10** — supports this order and reinforces Day 3 as the day on which “the Earth and its vegetation were sanctified.”
    
- **Psalm 104:14** — echoes Genesis 1:11–13: “He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for the service of man...”
    
- **1 Enoch 33:3–4** — refers to boundaries established for land and sea, likely referencing Day 3 work.
