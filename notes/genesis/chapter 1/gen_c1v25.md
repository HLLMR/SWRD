### **GENESIS 1:25**

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And Elohim made the beasts of the earth according to their kinds, and the livestock according to their kinds, and every creeping thing on the ground according to its kind; and Elohim saw that it was good.**

- **Hebrew (MT)**:  
    וַיַּעַשׂ אֱלֹהִים אֶת־חַיַּת הָאָרֶץ לְמִינָהּ וְאֶת־הַבְּהֵמָה לְמִינָהּ וְאֵת כָּל־רֶמֶשׂ הָאֲדָמָה לְמִינוֹ וַיַּרְא אֱלֹהִים כִּי־טוֹב
    
- **Transliteration**:  
    _Vayya‘as Elohim et chayyat ha’aretz leminah, ve’et habehēmah leminah, ve’et kol-remes ha’adamah lemino; vayyare Elohim ki-tov._
    
- **LXX (Brenton)**:  
    “And God made the wild beasts of the earth after their kind, and the cattle after their kind, and all the reptiles of the earth after their kind: and God saw that it was good.”
    
- **DSS (4QGen-Exoda)**:  
    No textual variants. Follows MT structure exactly.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

#### **“And Elohim made…” (וַיַּעַשׂ)**

- Shift from **“let the earth bring forth”** (v.24) to **“Elohim made”** here.
    
    - Hebrew _asah_ (עָשָׂה) = “to fashion, form, accomplish.”
        
    - This reinforces that **Elohim is the direct agent** of creation — not the earth acting independently.
        
    - As in previous verses, the earth is **the stage**, not the creator.
        

#### **Three categories reaffirmed, but reordered:**

1. **Chayyat ha’aretz** — “beasts of the earth” (wild animals).
    
2. **Behemah** — “livestock” or domestic animals.
    
3. **Remes ha’adamah** — “creeping things of the ground.”
    

- “Ha’adamah” (הָאֲדָמָה) = **ground/soil**, emphasizing low-level movement and **earthbound habitat** of these creatures (contrast with sea/air of Days 5).
    
- Repetition of **“according to its kind”** (x3) affirms fixed reproductive boundaries — one of Genesis 1’s most persistent creation laws.
    

#### **“And Elohim saw that it was good”**

- Final quality check before mankind is introduced.
    
- The land is now a **fully prepared environment**: dry ground, vegetation, and diverse land creatures — complete in function, form, and order.

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- The redundancy between vv.24–25 is often labeled a “doublet” or “editorial stitch” by liberal scholars — assuming multiple authors. But this **follows a common Hebraic narrative structure**: command → execution → evaluation.
    
- Evolutionary interpreters argue this reflects **progressive emergence** rather than fiat creation — but the Hebrew insists Elohim **personally made** all animal life **within a single day**.
    
- The phrase “according to its kind” is frequently brushed aside or allegorized to support **biological fluidity**, but it is **theologically and structurally central** to Genesis.

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

- **AM 0, Day 6 (mid-point)** — creation of all **land animals** is now complete.
    
- Everything is ready for the crowning act of creation: **man**, in the **image and likeness** of Elohim.

### 📖 Comparison:

- **KJV**: “And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind…”
    
    - Faithful, though “his kind” reflects older idiomatic usage; modern readers may misread it as anthropomorphic.
        
- **YLT**: “And God maketh the beast of the earth after its kind, and the cattle after its kind, and every creeping thing of the ground after its kind…”
    
    - Preserves Hebrew cadence and repetition well.

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

- **Jubilees 2:17** — “And on the sixth day He created all the beasts of the earth, and all cattle, and all that moves upon the earth.”
    
    - Perfect harmony with Genesis; no additional expansion needed.
        
- **1 Enoch** begins symbolic interpretations of beasts in later visions but does not interleave at the point of their creation.
    
- **Book of Jasher** does not enter the narrative until Adam’s creation.
