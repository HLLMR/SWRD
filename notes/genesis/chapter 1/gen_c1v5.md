### **GENESIS 1:5**

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic + TR basis):

**And Elohim called the light Day, and the darkness He called Night. And there was evening, and there was morning — the first day.**

- **Hebrew**: וַיִּקְרָא אֱלֹהִים לָאוֹר יוֹם וְלַחֹשֶׁךְ קָרָא לָיְלָה וַיְהִי־עֶרֶב וַיְהִי־בֹקֶר יוֹם אֶחָד
    
- **Transliteration**: _Vayyiqra Elohim la'or yom, vela'choshekh qara laylah; vayehi erev vayehi boker — yom echad._

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

#### **"And Elohim called..." (וַיִּקְרָא אֱלֹהִים)**

- The act of **naming** is a declaration of authority. Naming is **dominion language** — a theme that will continue with Adam in Genesis 2.
    
- **Naming light “Day” and darkness “Night”** establishes **functional roles**, not just labels. This verse finalizes the **cosmic order** for timekeeping, despite the sun and moon not yet being created.
    

#### **"Evening and morning" (עֶרֶב...בֹקֶר)**

- The order is **evening first**, then morning — this forms the basis of **Hebrew calendrical reckoning**, where days begin at sunset.
    
- This phrasing is repeated as a **structural refrain** for each day of creation.
    
- **“Evening” (erev)** implies the **cessation of light**, and **“morning” (boker)** the **return or dawning** of light — not the passage of astronomical hours.
    

#### **"Day One" (יוֹם אֶחָד)**

- The phrase used is **“yom echad”** — **not** “first day” (which would be _yom rishon_).
    
- “Echad” means **one, unified, singular** — possibly emphasizing the **completeness** or **primacy** of this day.
    
- Sets precedent for **literal 24-hour cycles**, initiated even without sun and moon — indicating **God-ordained time**, not solar-based time.
    

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- The phrase “yom echad” has been used by old-earth theologians to argue a symbolic day — but the consistent refrain **“evening and morning”** across all six days destroys that argument.
    
- Attempts to tie this verse to evolutionary or geologic “ages” contradict both grammar and context.
    
- Roman and modern critical traditions avoid the implications of **literal time cycles initiated by divine fiat**, preferring solar explanations incompatible with the text’s timeline.

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

- **AM 0, Day 1 concluded** — time itself is now measurable; **the first literal day** is complete.
    
- No indication of gap between these phases — they follow in seamless sequence from verse 3 to 5.

### 📖 Comparison:

- **KJV**: “And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.”
    
    - “First day” is a mistranslation — should be **“one day”** or **“day one”** (not ordinal).
        
- **YLT**: “And God calleth to the light ‘Day,’ and to the darkness He hath called ‘Night;’ and there is an evening, and there is a morning — day one.”
    
    - Preserves literal phrasing better and maintains the Hebrew word order.

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

- **Jubilees 2:2–3** — directly affirms this ordering: “And Elohim separated the light from the darkness, and appointed the light as the day and the darkness as the night, and ordained the sun and moon and stars later for signs and times.”
    
- **1 Enoch 72** — discusses appointed times and luminaries, reinforcing that **days can exist prior to celestial bodies**.
    
- **Dead Sea Scroll fragments** (e.g., 4QGenesisb) support the **early structure of time** as originating directly from Elohim’s creative word, not heavenly motion.
