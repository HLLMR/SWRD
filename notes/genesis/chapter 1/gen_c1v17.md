### **GENESIS 1:17**

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And Elohim set them in the firmament of the heavens to give light upon the earth.**

- **Hebrew (MT)**: וַיִּתֵּן אֹתָם אֱלֹהִים בִּרְקִיעַ הַשָּׁמַיִם לְהָאִיר עַל־הָאָרֶץ
    
- **Transliteration**: _Vayyiten otam Elohim birqia hashamayim, le’ha’ir al ha’aretz._
    
- **LXX (Brenton)**: “And God placed them in the firmament of the heaven, so as to shine upon the earth.”
    
- **DSS (4QGen-Exoda)**: Matches MT exactly; no variation in this verse.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

#### **“And Elohim set them...” (וַיִּתֵּן אֹתָם)**

- **Vayyiten (וַיִּתֵּן)**: “set,” “appointed,” or “established.” It implies **intentional placement** — not emergence or natural positioning.
    
- **Otam (אֹתָם)**: “them” — refers directly to the **two great lights** and **stars** of v.16.
    

#### **“In the firmament of the heavens” (בִּרְקִיעַ הַשָּׁמַיִם)**

- Repetition for emphasis — the **third** mention of placement _inside_ the **raqia**. This drives home the **enclosed cosmological model**:
    
    - Firmament is the **container**,
        
    - Lights are **set within it**,
        
    - Their light is **projected downward** to Earth.
        
- There is **no room in the Hebrew text** for placing stars “beyond” or “outside” the firmament.
    

#### **“To give light upon the earth” (לְהָאִיר עַל־הָאָרֶץ)**

- Same phrase as v.15 — this is the **execution** of the stated purpose:
    
    - Not light for the cosmos,
        
    - Not illumination of other worlds,
        
    - But **light directed specifically upon the earth** — the intended realm of habitation and dominion.

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Heliocentric cosmology places stars at **immeasurable distances**, far outside any local system — which Genesis 1 **categorically denies**.
    
- Modern Bibles and study notes often say “sky” or “space,” avoiding the **firmament structure**, despite all major ancient witnesses (including LXX) affirming its solidity and domain boundaries.
    
- The idea that the stars are “natural” or “accidental” objects is countered here: they are **set by Elohim**, for **deliberate earthly purpose**.

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

- **AM 0, Day 4 (finalized phase)** — celestial luminaries now fully installed, located, and functioning.
    
- Time is now not only **divinely declared**, but **observably marked** by the created order.

### 📖 Comparison:

- **KJV**: “And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth.”
    
    - Follows MT closely, though again uses singular “heaven.”
        
- **YLT**: “And God giveth them in the expanse of the heavens to give light upon the earth.”
    
    - Preserves the act of placing, but substitutes “expanse” for “firmament.”

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

- **Jubilees 2:11–12** — confirms the role of sun, moon, and stars as **placed within the firmament**, to shine and to regulate.
    
- **1 Enoch 77:1–4** — categorizes **fixed stars** and their positions relative to Earth, affirming **locality and intention**.
    
- **2 Baruch 59:2** — “The stars shall fall from heaven, and the sun shall be turned into darkness” — this only makes sense if they are **in a local firmament**, not light-years away.
