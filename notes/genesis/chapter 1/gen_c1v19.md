#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And there was evening, and there was morning — the fourth day.**

- **Hebrew (MT)**: וַיְהִי־עֶרֶב וַיְהִי־בֹקֶר יוֹם רְבִיעִי
    
- **Transliteration**: _Vayehi erev, vayehi boker — yom revi‘i._
    
- **LXX (Brenton)**: “And there was evening and there was morning, the fourth day.”
    
- **DSS (4QGen-Exoda)**: Conforms fully to Masoretic; no variant.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

#### **“And there was evening, and there was morning”**

- Continues the **evening-first** pattern, marking the **biblical day** as beginning at sundown — a system later institutionalized in Torah (cf. Leviticus 23:32).
    
- This phrasebook structure is not poetic filler — it’s **ritualized time framing**, essential for sabbath cycles, appointed feasts (_mo’adim_), and agricultural timing.
    

#### **“The fourth day” (יוֹם רְבִיעִי)**

- Hebrew ordinal **revi‘i** means “fourth,” continuing the sequence from “second” (v.8) and “third” (v.13).
    
- Day Four is now complete — the **visible structure of timekeeping is now fully in place**:
    
    - Sun governs **day**,
        
    - Moon governs **night**,
        
    - Stars serve as **supplementary markers**.

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- The continued, structured repetition of “evening and morning” is frequently dismissed by commentators who prefer **non-literal creation timelines** (e.g., Day-Age or Framework Hypothesis).
    
- Some Christian and Jewish traditions shift their theology to **solar-based or Roman-based timekeeping**, ignoring the **sundown-to-sundown system** Elohim established.
    
- Modern lectionary systems and calendars (Gregorian, Julian) detach timekeeping from this **divinely instituted order**.

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

- **AM 0, Day 4 complete** — now four full solar/lunar days have elapsed since creation’s initiation.
    
- This confirms that **Genesis 1:1–19 fits into a single, coherent week** — not ages or allegories.

### 📖 Comparison:

- **KJV**: “And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.”
    
    - Stylistically reversed from Hebrew but carries the same meaning.
        
- **YLT**: “And there is an evening, and there is a morning — day fourth.”
    
    - Maintains Hebrew cadence; archaic but accurate.

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

- **Jubilees 2:13–14** — concludes Day Four: “And thus was the work of the fourth day completed. And all the luminaries that are in heaven were finished.”
    
- **1 Enoch 82:4–9** — outlines luminary functions established on Day Four, especially their timing for days, months, and appointed feasts.
