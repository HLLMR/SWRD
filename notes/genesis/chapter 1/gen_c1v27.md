### **GENESIS 1:27**

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And Elohim created the man in His own image; in the image of Elohim He created him — male and female He created them.**

- **Hebrew (MT)**:  
    וַיִּבְרָא אֱלֹהִים אֶת־הָאָדָם בְּצַלְמוֹ בְּצֶלֶם אֱלֹהִים בָּרָא אֹתוֹ זָכָר וּנְקֵבָה בָּרָא אֹתָם
    
- **Transliteration**:  
    _Vayyivra Elohim et ha’adam b’tzalmo; b’tzelem Elohim bara oto — zakhar u’neqevah bara otam._
    
- **LXX (Brenton)**:  
    “And God made man, according to the image of God He made him; male and female He made them.”
    
- **DSS (4QGen-Exoda)**:  
    Fully matches MT — no variant readings.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

#### **“And Elohim created the man…” (אֶת־הָאָדָם)**

- **Ha’adam (the man)** — definite article; this is not humanity in general, but **the archetypal man**, **Adam**.
    
    - This **does not contradict** the “them” of v.26 — Hebrew uses singular and plural fluidly for representative beings.
        
- This is the **execution** of the divine deliberation from v.26.
    

#### **“In His own image… in the image of Elohim”**

- The phrase is repeated **for emphasis** — a poetic parallelism in Hebrew structure:
    
    - **“In His own image” (בְּצַלְמוֹ)** = divine imprint.
        
    - **“In the image of Elohim” (בְּצֶלֶם אֱלֹהִים)** = clarifies the image is **not** angelic or lesser being — but uniquely **divine**.
        
- Unlike animals, man is not created “according to kind” — **he is his own kind**, made **after Elohim**.
    

#### **“Male and female He created them”**

- Hebrew: **זָכָר וּנְקֵבָה (zakhar u’neqevah)** — biologically binary, inseparable from **image-bearing function**.
    
- “Created them” — though woman is not physically formed until Gen 2:22, this verse affirms:
    
    - **Both sexes are included in the original design**.
        
    - Both **fully share the divine image** and dominion authority.
        
- This also nullifies any **pagan or gnostic gender hierarchies** — male and female are created **in unity**, not sequence.

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Some traditions (especially Gnostic or Catholic mystical strains) read this as androgynous or spiritual duality — but the Hebrew is **biological and complementary**, not blended.
    
- Liberal theology often dismisses “image of God” as **figurative or moralistic** — but Genesis gives it **structural, functional, and ontological weight**.
    
- Feminist theology sometimes claims female was an afterthought — yet this verse confirms she was **present in intent and blessing from the beginning**.

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

- **AM 0, Day 6 (late)** — **first man and woman** are created in Elohim’s image.
    
- The **physical creation of woman** is detailed in Genesis 2 — but the **commissioning and identity** are already present here.
    

---

### 📖 Comparison:

- **KJV**: “So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.”
    
    - Excellent fidelity and rhythm — matches Hebrew cadence.
        
- **YLT**: “And God prepareth the man in His image; in the image of God He prepared him, a male and a female He prepared them.”
    
    - “Prepareth” is an unusual rendering of _bara_ — less accurate here.

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

- **Jubilees 2:19–21** — “He created him and gave him dominion… male and female He created them…”
    
    - Matches Genesis but adds early details about **Eden’s preparation**, which interleave well with Gen 2.
        
- **1 Enoch 69:11–12** — confirms man’s dominion and spiritual responsibility.
    
- **Book of Jasher 1:2** — begins with the physical creation of Adam from the dust, and the forming of Eve from his rib — good material to begin layering after Gen 2:7.
