### **GENESIS 1:9**

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And Elohim said, “Let the waters under the Heavens be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear.” And it was so.**

- **Hebrew (MT)**: וַיֹּאמֶר אֱלֹהִים יִקָּווּ הַמַּיִם מִתַּחַת הַשָּׁמַיִם אֶל־מָקוֹם אֶחָד וְתֵרָאֶה הַיַּבָּשָׁה וַיְהִי־כֵן
    
- **Transliteration**: _Vayomer Elohim, yiqqavu hamayim mitachat hashamayim el-makom echad; veteira'eh hayabashah; vayehi ken._
    
- **LXX (Brenton)**: “And God said, Let the water which is under the heaven be collected into one place, and let the dry land appear; and it was so.”
    
- **DSS (4QGen-Exoda)**: Fragment supports the MT text with no significant variance here.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

#### **“Let the waters under the Heavens be gathered...”**

- The phrase **“under the Heavens”** (מִתַּחַת הַשָּׁמַיִם) reinforces the **firmament structure** established in verses 6–8. These are **lower waters**, beneath the _raqia_.
    
- **Yiqqavu (יִקָּווּ)**: from _qavah_, “to bind or collect” — a deliberate **concentration** or **pooling** of waters into defined locations.
    
- The gathering of waters suggests **basins** or **oceanic boundaries**, not uniform water coverage — supporting **continental landmasses** from the start.
    

#### **“Unto one place...”**

- **Makom echad (מָקוֹם אֶחָד)** — “one place” may imply a **single pre-Flood ocean** or contiguous water body, possibly encircling a **single landmass**.
    
- This may reflect the **“Pangaea-like” state** in pre-Flood Earth models, which would later fracture (cf. Genesis 10:25 – “in the days of Peleg... the earth was divided”).
    

#### **“Let the dry land appear...”**

- **Yabashah (יַּבָּשָׁה)**: dry ground — distinct from **eretz**, which can mean land, earth, or country. This is **visible, inhabitable landmass**.
    
- The emergence of land is a **visual revelation** — the word **“appear” (וְתֵרָאֶה)** means to **be seen**, not to be created from nothing at this point.
    

#### **“And it was so”**

- The same execution formula seen throughout Genesis 1 — emphasizes **direct fulfillment** of divine command.

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Many modern commentaries **assume pre-existing continents** or **geologic ages** behind this event — but the text gives **no allowance for time gaps** or naturalistic processes.
    
- The idea that land slowly emerged over eons contradicts the text’s plain claim: **Elohim spoke, and land appeared**.

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

- **AM 0, Day 3 begins** — first phase: formation of land from beneath the lower waters.
    
- This is the **first appearance of solid ground** — preparing the Earth for vegetation and habitation.

### 📖 Comparison:

- **KJV**: “And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.”
    
    - Faithful to the original — but again uses singular “heaven” instead of plural **Heavens**.
        
- **YLT**: “And God saith, ‘Let the waters under the heavens be collected unto one place, and let the dry land appear:’ and it is so.”
    
    - Better preserves plural “heavens” and structure.

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

- **Jubilees 2:5** — reaffirms: “On the third day He commanded the waters to be gathered together from the face of the whole earth into one place, and the dry land to appear.”
    
- **1 Enoch 60:16** — speaks of the separation of waters and the founding of the land as part of Enoch’s cosmological vision.
    
- **Baruch 3:32–34 (LXX)** — credits Elohim with founding the Earth on the waters, echoing Psalm 24:2 and Genesis 1:9.
