### **GENESIS 1:8**

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And Elohim called the firmament Heaven. And there was evening, and there was morning — day two.**

- **Hebrew (MT)**: וַיִּקְרָא אֱלֹהִים לָרָקִיעַ שָׁמָיִם וַיְהִי־עֶרֶב וַיְהִי־בֹקֶר יוֹם שֵׁנִי
    
- **Transliteration**: _Vayyiqra Elohim la-raqia shamayim; vayehi erev vayehi boker — yom sheni._
    
- **LXX (Brenton)**: “And God called the firmament Heaven. And there was evening and there was morning, the second day.”
    
- **DSS (4QGen-Exoda)**: Aligns with MT; no significant variant in this verse.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

#### **"And Elohim called the firmament Heaven"**

- **Shamayim (שָׁמָיִם)**: the Hebrew term for **“heavens”**, a plural form. Here, the **firmament is directly named “Heavens”** by Elohim — not synonymous with open space, but with the **vaulted expanse** He just established.
    
- The **naming** continues the divine dominion motif — **calling = authority**, as seen also in verse 5.
    

#### **Heaven ≠ Sky ≠ Atmosphere**

- This is **not the spiritual Heaven** (cf. 2 Corinthians 12:2: “third heaven”), nor merely air or space.
    
- It is the **visible dome** above Earth, **beneath which the birds fly** (Genesis 1:20), and **above which are waters** (Genesis 1:7; Psalm 148:4).
    

#### **"Evening and morning — day two"**

- Repeats the same pattern from verse 5: **day begins at evening**, not midnight or morning.
    
- **“Yom sheni”** — literally, **“second day”**, now switching to **ordinal** numbering (unlike “day one” in v.5). This establishes sequential day structure from this point forward.
    

_Notably, this is the only day of the six with **no declaration of “it was good”** — a silence that has prompted ancient speculation._

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- The **identification of “Heaven” with the firmament** has been systematically removed from most modern theology.
    
    - Commentaries increasingly treat “heaven” here as symbolic or interchangeable with outer space or “sky,” which breaks the text’s logic.
        
- The lack of a “good” declaration on day two is often overlooked — **possibly tied to the division of waters** (judgment imagery) or because **day three completes the outcome** begun here.

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

- **AM 0, Day 2 completed** — the space between waters is now fully structured and named.
    
- The **cosmic vertical layers** are now established:
    
    - Waters above
        
    - Firmament (Heaven)
        
    - Waters below

### 📖 Comparison:

- **KJV**: “And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day.”
    
    - Accurately renders the structure.
        
- **YLT**: “And God calleth to the expanse ‘Heavens;’ and there is an evening, and there is a morning — day second.”
    
    - Closer to Hebrew syntax but again uses “expanse,” which weakens the cosmological precision of _raqia_.

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

- **Jubilees 2:4–5** mirrors this: “He called the firmament Heaven above, and it was evening and it was morning, the second day.”
    
- **1 Enoch 18:3–5** speaks of a firm structure where the heavens are measured — reinforcing literal layering.
    
- **Baruch 3:24–25 (LXX/Apocrypha)** describes the heavens as created by command and structured by wisdom — supportive of Elohim naming and fixing cosmic domains.
