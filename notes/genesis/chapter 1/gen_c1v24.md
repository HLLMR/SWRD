### **GENESIS 1:24**

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And Elohim said, “Let the earth bring forth living creatures according to their kinds: livestock, and creeping things, and beasts of the earth, each according to its kind.” And it was so.**

- **Hebrew (MT)**: וַיֹּאמֶר אֱלֹהִים תּוֹצֵא הָאָרֶץ נֶפֶשׁ חַיָּה לְמִינָהּ בְּהֵמָה וָרֶמֶשׂ וְחַיַּת־אֶרֶץ לְמִינָהּ וַיְהִי־כֵן
    
- **Transliteration**: _Vayomer Elohim: totzei ha’aretz nefesh chayyah leminah — behemah, varemes, vechayyat-eretz leminah; vayehi ken._
    
- **LXX (Brenton)**: “And God said, Let the earth bring forth living creatures after their kind, cattle and reptiles and wild beasts of the earth after their kind: and it was so.”
    
- **DSS (4QGen-Exoda)**: No significant variation; matches Masoretic syntax and vocabulary.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

#### **“Let the earth bring forth living creatures according to their kinds”**

- **Totzei ha’aretz** — “Let the earth bring forth” — not implying evolution, but **instantaneous appearance from Earth’s domain** by divine fiat.
    
    - Same construction as “let the waters swarm…” in v.20, but here applied to **land-based life**.
        
- **Nefesh chayyah leminah** — “living soul according to its kind”:
    
    - Again emphasizes **distinct created boundaries** — no transitional forms, no evolutionary gradients.
        
    - “Soul” (_nefesh_) is applied to animals, not just man — indicating **conscious, breathing life**, but without eternal spirit (which is _neshamah_).
        

#### **Three categories are named explicitly:**

1. **Behemah (בְּהֵמָה)** — domesticated or herd animals (e.g., cattle, sheep, oxen).
    
2. **Remes (רֶמֶשׂ)** — “creeping things,” includes small crawling creatures like reptiles, amphibians, insects.
    
3. **Chayyat-eretz (חַיַּת־אֶרֶץ)** — “beasts of the earth,” typically refers to wild, undomesticated animals (e.g., lions, bears, etc.).
    

- This trifold division becomes foundational for **sacrificial laws**, **Noah’s ark classifications**, and **clean/unclean distinctions** later in Torah.
    

#### **“And it was so” (וַיְהִי־כֵן)**

- Immediate affirmation of divine command — not a process over time, but **accomplishment by speech**.
    
- This phrase ends every major creative act in Genesis 1, serving as a **seal of execution**.

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- The phrase “let the earth bring forth…” has been distorted by evolutionary theologians to imply **naturalistic emergence** — but in Hebrew, the **agent of action is God**, and the earth is **the medium**, not the originator.
    
- The consistent phrase “according to their kinds” is often **ignored or reinterpreted** to allow for species fluidity — contrary to the text’s fixed-category framework.
    
- Modern translations often generalize or soften these categories (e.g., replacing “creeping things” with “small animals”) to avoid **literal cosmology** and **Levitical precision**.

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

- **AM 0, beginning of Day 6** — the dry land is now populated with **animal life**, preparing for the final act: **the creation of man**.
    
- This is the last full day of creative labor — and will include the **only being made in Elohim’s image**.

### 📖 Comparison:

- **KJV**: “Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.”
    
    - Fairly close, though archaic singular “creature… his kind” adds anthropomorphic tone.
        
- **YLT**: “Let the earth bring forth the living creature after its kind, cattle and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after its kind: and it is so.”
    
    - Sticks closely to Hebrew word order.

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

- **Jubilees 2:16–17** — “On the sixth day He created all the animals of the earth, and all cattle, and all that move upon the earth.”
    
    - Confirms the trifold division and matches Genesis terminology closely.
        
- **1 Enoch 89:10–12 (Shepherd Vision)** — symbolically uses different land animals to represent nations and spiritual lineages — suggests these animal types had **spiritual typology from the start**.
    
- **Book of Jasher (1:2)** — mentions beasts in Adam’s presence, but does not describe their creation — no interleave here, but later relevance.
