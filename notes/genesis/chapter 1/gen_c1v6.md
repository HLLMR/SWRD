### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

#### **"Let there be a firmament..." (יְהִי רָקִיעַ)**

- **Raqia (רָקִיעַ)**: from the root _raqa_ (רָקַע), meaning **to beat out, stamp, or spread like metal**. This word denotes a **solid expanse**, not a vapor canopy or abstract atmosphere.
    
- LXX renders it **stereōma (στερέωμα)** — “solid structure” — further confirming early understanding of **firm materiality**.
    
- Historically and scripturally understood as the **vault or dome** over the Earth — consistent with:
    
    - **Job 37:18** — “Hast thou with him spread out the sky, which is strong, and as a molten looking glass?”
        
    - **Psalm 19:1** — “The firmament declareth the glory of El.”
        

#### **"In the midst of the waters..." (בְּתוֹךְ הַמַּיִם)**

- The firmament is created **within** the pre-existing waters — suggesting the Earth was first surrounded by **a continuous deep**.
    
- This places the **raqia between two water domains**, dividing **waters above** from **waters below**.
    

#### **"And let it divide the waters from the waters..." (וִיהִי מַבְדִּיל בֵּין מַיִם לָמָיִם)**

- The verb **mavdil (מַבְדִּיל)** means “to separate, divide, distinguish.”
    
- This introduces a second act of **cosmic division**, following the earlier division of light and darkness.
    
- Confirms that **water remains above and below** after this act — not all water is gathered below.

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Nearly all modern translations render **raqia** as “expanse” or “sky,” obscuring its **solid nature** and flattening biblical cosmology to fit heliocentric models.
    
- This reinterpretation arises post-Copernicus, amplified by Enlightenment rationalism and pressure to harmonize with secular science.
    
- Roman Catholic and Protestant commentaries have largely abandoned literal firmament doctrine — despite universal early agreement on a **vaulted, enclosed Earth system**.

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

- **AM 0, Day 2 begins** — this creative act defines the second day.
    
- Marks the introduction of **structured space** within creation — a **habitable zone** now exists between upper and lower waters.

### 📖 Comparison:

- **KJV**: “And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.”
    
    - Retains “firmament” — one of the few translations to preserve the word, though not its meaning.
        
- **YLT**: “And God saith, ‘Let an expanse be in the midst of the waters, and let it be separating between waters and waters.’”
    
    - “Expanse” weakens the concrete, structural connotation of **raqia**.

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

- **Jubilees 2:4** — reaffirms: “And on the second day He created the firmament in the midst of the waters, and the waters were divided that day — half of them went up above, and half of them went down below the firmament.”
    
- **1 Enoch 69:22** speaks of **“the firmament of the heaven which is above the waters”**, reinforcing the vertical layering.
    
- **Dead Sea Scrolls (4QGenesis Apocryphon)** include imagery of **cosmic vaults** and **heavenly boundaries**, affirming the **three-tiered cosmology**.
