### **GENESIS 1:26**

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And Elohim said, “Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness. And let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the flying creatures of the heavens, and over the livestock, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps upon the earth.”**

- **Hebrew (MT)**:  
    וַיֹּאמֶר אֱלֹהִים נַעֲשֶׂה אָדָם בְּצַלְמֵנוּ כִּדְמוּתֵנוּ וְיִרְדוּ בִדְגַת הַיָּם וּבְעוֹף הַשָּׁמַיִם וּבַבְּהֵמָה וּבְכָל־הָאָרֶץ וּבְכָל־הָרֶמֶשׂ הָרֹמֵשׂ עַל־הָאָרֶץ
    
- **Transliteration**:  
    _Vayomer Elohim: na‘aseh adam b’tzalmenu kid’mutenu, v’yirdu vidgat hayam, uve‘oph hashamayim, uvabhemah, uv’khol ha’aretz, uv’khol ha’remes haromes al ha’aretz._
    
- **LXX (Brenton)**:  
    “And God said, Let us make man according to our image and likeness, and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and the birds of the sky, and the cattle, and all the earth, and all the reptiles that creep on the earth.”
    
- **DSS (4QGen-Exoda)**:  
    Fully matches MT — no known textual variant in this verse.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

#### **“Let Us make man…”**

- **Nouns are plural** — _na‘aseh (נַעֲשֶׂה)_ = “let Us make”
    
    - Plural construction of **Elohim (אֱלֹהִים)** already implies **a complex unity**.
        
    - The “Us” cannot refer to angels — **no evidence** they participate in man’s creation. This is a **Divine Council** deliberation within the Godhead.
        
    - The early Messianic reading sees this as **Father, Son, and Spirit** working in unity (cf. John 1:1–3, Colossians 1:16).
        

#### **“In Our image, according to Our likeness”**

- **Tzelem (צֶלֶם)** = image, shadow, representation.
    
- **Demut (דְּמוּת)** = likeness, pattern, model.
    
    - These are **not interchangeable synonyms** — _tzelem_ implies **form**, _demut_ implies **function or nature**.
        
    - Mankind is given a **functional resemblance** and a **representative form** — a reflection of Elohim’s nature and authority.
        

> ⚠️ Important: Nowhere does this imply that man **is** Elohim — only that he is made **to image Him**, a steward under divine rule.

#### **“Let them have dominion…”**

- **V’yirdu (וְיִרְדוּ)** = from root _radah_ — to rule, govern, subdue.
    
    - This is the **first commissioning** of mankind — not only to exist, but to **govern Earth under divine authority**.
        
    - **Male and female** are both implied by **plural pronoun** “them” before either is individually named (v.27).
        

#### **Scope of dominion includes:**

1. **Fish of the sea** — all aquatic life.
    
2. **Flying creatures of the heavens** — all airborne life.
    
3. **Livestock** — domestic land animals.
    
4. **All the earth** — total environmental stewardship.
    
5. **Every creeping thing** — insects, reptiles, small fauna.

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- **The plural “Let Us” is often explained away** by Trinitarian skeptics or liberal theologians as “majestic plural” or divine-angelic speech. The grammar does not support this — nowhere else is divine speech inclusive of angels in creation.
    
- Some traditions downplay or allegorize “image and likeness” to reduce **man's ontological value**, paving the way for **nihilistic evolutionism** or **authoritarian control systems** that deny divine purpose.
    
- Dominion is routinely conflated with **exploitation** in modern interpretations — but the Hebrew calls for **wise rulership**, not abuse. The concept is **royal stewardship**, not tyranny.

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

- **AM 0, Day 6 (late)** — the planning phase of mankind's creation.
    
- Execution will occur in the next verse (v.27), followed by **Elohim’s blessing and commission**.

### 📖 Comparison:

- **KJV**: “Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion…”
    
    - Accurately reflects both plural speech and function.
        
- **YLT**: “Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness, and let them rule…”
    
    - Keeps close to Hebrew intent; “rule” captures _radah_ well.

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

- **Jubilees 2:18–19** — “And He created man in His own image… and He gave him dominion over all things upon the earth.”
    
    - Confirms divine image and dominion commission; no angels mentioned as co-creators.
        
- **1 Enoch 69:11–12** — refers to **man being created to rule the earth** while angels were assigned to heaven — affirms separation of domains.
    
- **Book of Jasher 1:1–2** — begins with God forming Adam and breathing into him; can be interleaved after v.27.
