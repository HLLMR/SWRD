### **GENESIS 1:29**

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And Elohim said, “Behold, I have given you every plant yielding seed that is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree in which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed — to you it shall be for food.”**

- **Hebrew (MT)**:  
    וַיֹּאמֶר אֱלֹהִים הִנֵּה נָתַתִּי לָכֶם אֶת־כָּל־עֵשֶׂב זֹרֵעַ זֶרַע אֲשֶׁר עַל־פְּנֵי כָל־הָאָרֶץ וְאֶת־כָּל־הָעֵץ אֲשֶׁר־בּוֹ פְּרִי־עֵץ זֹרֵעַ זֶרַע לָכֶם יִהְיֶה לְאָכְלָה
    
- **Transliteration**:  
    _Vayomer Elohim: hinneh natatti lachem et kol-esev zorea zera asher al-penei kol ha’aretz, ve’et kol-ha’etz asher bo peri-etz zorea zera — lachem yihyeh le’ochlah._
    
- **LXX (Brenton)**:  
    “And God said, Behold, I have given to you every seed-bearing herb sowing seed which is upon all the earth, and every tree which has in itself the fruit of seed that is sown — to you it shall be for food.”
    
- **DSS (4QGen-Exoda)**:  
    Text matches MT fully; no known differences.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

#### **“Behold, I have given you…” (הִנֵּה נָתַתִּי לָכֶם)**

- This is a **royal grant formula** — similar to covenant language later in Torah.
    
- Elohim speaks as **sovereign ruler bestowing lawful provision** — not simply pointing out what’s edible, but **declaring a permitted diet**.
    

#### **“Every plant yielding seed… every tree in which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed”**

- Two categories:
    
    1. **Herbs/greens** that produce seed — includes grains, vegetables.
        
    2. **Trees that produce fruit** containing seed — includes orchard fruits.
        
- This is a **complete vegetarian diet** — no mention of meat, eggs, or dairy.
    
    - The grammar limits man’s food to **seed-bearing plant matter only**.
        
- This dietary mandate continues **unchanged until Genesis 9:3**, after the flood.
    

#### **“To you it shall be for food”**

- Hebrew **lachem yihyeh le’ochlah (לָכֶם יִהְיֶה לְאָכְלָה)** — a strong declarative statement.
    
- Not just descriptive — **this is a divine ordinance**.

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- This verse is often **overlooked** in doctrines of dominion — yet it shows that **man's rule was to be exercised within dietary boundaries**.
    
- Catholic and many Protestant traditions historically emphasize **meat and sacrifice** as essential to worship and civilization — but **Elohim’s original provision was plant-based**, emphasizing peace and non-violence.
    
- Gnostic interpretations twist this to condemn physical nourishment altogether — the text plainly **upholds physical creation and food as “good.”**

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

- **AM 0, Day 6 (final phase)** — man and woman are created, blessed, commissioned, and now **granted lawful sustenance**.
    
- The Earth, now fully ordered, supports **biological life and spiritual stewardship**.

### 📖 Comparison:

- **KJV**: “Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed… and every tree… yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.”
    
    - “Meat” here means “food,” but this can be confusing in modern English.
        
- **YLT**: “Lo, I have given to you every herb sowing seed… and every tree in which is the fruit of a tree sowing seed — to you it is for food.”
    
    - Precise and clear, though a bit awkward in rhythm.

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

- **Jubilees 3:12** — confirms Adam and Eve’s **plant-based food** in Eden.
    
- **Jubilees 6:1–4** — later reinforces that only **clean animals** were used for sacrifice, not food, until Noah.
    
- **1 Enoch 7:5** — says the Watchers corrupted mankind to eat blood and flesh — **post-Fall distortion** of this original command.
    
- **Book of Jasher** does not discuss diet at this stage — but picks up with sacrifice and offering after the Fall.
