### **GENESIS 1:2**

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic + TR basis):

**And the earth became without form and void, and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of Elohim was hovering over the face of the waters.**

- **Hebrew**: וְהָיְתָה הָאָרֶץ תֹּהוּ וָבֹהוּ וְחֹשֶׁךְ עַל־פְּנֵי תְהוֹם וְרוּחַ אֱלֹהִים מְרַחֶפֶת עַל־פְּנֵי הַמָּיִם
    
- **Transliteration**: _Ve'hayetah ha'aretz tohu va'vohu, ve'choshekh al-pnei tehom; veruach Elohim merachefet al-pnei ha'mayim._

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

#### 🔍 **“And the earth became...” (וְהָיְתָה)**

- Verb **הָיְתָה (hayetah)** is properly rendered as **"became"** not simply "was." This supports the reading that something **changed** between v.1 and v.2.
    
    - This has historically been downplayed to defend creation ex nihilo without disruption.
        
    - Compare with Jeremiah 4:23, which also uses _tohu va'vohu_ for a judgment context — **not** original design.
        

#### 🌀 **"Tohu va’vohu" (תֹּהוּ וָבֹהוּ)**

- Literal: _formless and void_, or better, _chaotic and empty_.
    
- These terms connote desolation, ruin, or uninhabitable condition.
    
- Used **elsewhere only in Isaiah 34:11 and Jeremiah 4:23**, both in judgment scenes — potentially hinting at a **catastrophic event**.
    

#### 🌑 **"Darkness was upon the face of the deep" (חֹשֶׁךְ עַל־פְּנֵי תְהוֹם)**

- **Tehom (תְּהוֹם)** = the deep, abyss, primeval ocean.
    
    - Root-linked to Ugaritic and Akkadian chaos waters (_Tiamat_). This does **not** imply myth — it reflects the _common cultural memory_ of pre-formed waters.
        
    - “Darkness” pre-exists light — a condition, not a thing.
        

#### 🕊️ **"Spirit of Elohim was hovering" (רוּחַ אֱלֹהִים מְרַחֶפֶת)**

- **Ruach Elohim**: can mean **wind, breath, or spirit** — here, clearly divine presence.
    
- **Merachefet (מְרַחֶפֶת)**: rare word, found again only in **Deuteronomy 32:11** (“as an eagle flutters over her young”) — denotes **protective, dynamic movement**.
    

#### 💧 **"Over the face of the waters"**

- The waters already exist — not yet separated by firmament.
    
- No landmass yet visible.

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Mainstream theology avoids “became” and the possibility of a **pre-Adamic judgment** or **chaotic interval** between v.1 and v.2.
    
- Rome’s allegorical method suppresses direct links to **angelic rebellion**, often discussed in **Enoch, Jubilees, and Job**.
    
- The "Gap Theory" misuses this verse to justify an old Earth — but a **brief gap (e.g., days or weeks)** caused by angelic rebellion is more scripturally consistent than the deep-time insertion.
    

---

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

- **AM 0 + unknown interval** — possible early period of angelic activity, rebellion, and judgment preceding Day 1 (light).
    
- If linking with **Enoch 12–16**, the rebellion of Watchers occurred _before_ Adam but _after_ Earth’s formation — fits within this possible gap.
    

---

### 📖 Comparison:

- **KJV**: “And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep.”
    
    - Renders **“was”** instead of “became” — obscures possible event.
        
- **YLT**: “And the earth hath existed waste and void, and darkness is on the face of the deep…”
    
    - Slightly more nuanced but still not capturing full **becoming**.

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

- **Jubilees 2:2** — covers the beginning of creation, waters, and spirit.
    
- **1 Enoch 6–10** — tells of the Watchers descending to Earth, but possibly post-creation.
    
- **Book of Jasher (Chapter 1)** begins with Adam already placed, so not interleaved here yet.
    
- Consider Job 38:7 — the **“morning stars”** (angels) shouting at creation implies their **existence before man**, possibly _before v.2_.
