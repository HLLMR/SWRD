### **GENESIS 8:12**

_Scroll of Noaḥ_  
(Traditional Genesis 8:12)  
**The Dove Does Not Return**

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And he waited yet another seven days and sent out the dove, and she did not return to him again.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וַיִּיָּחֶל עוֹד שִׁבְעַת יָמִים אֲחֵרִים  
וַיְשַׁלַּח אֶת־הַיּוֹנָה  
וְלֹא־יָסְפָה שׁוּב אֵלָיו עוֹד

---

#### Transliteration:

_Vayyiyyaḥel ʿod shivʿat yamim acheirim,  
vayyishallaḥ et-hayyona,  
ve’lo yasfah shuv elav ʿod._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And having waited yet seven other days, he again sent forth the dove; and she did not return to him again any more.”

> The LXX supports the MT directly — emphasizing the finality of the dove’s mission: **no return = land is habitable**.

---

#### DSS (4QGen):

Fully confirms the MT structure and phrasing. The phrase **“did not return to him again”** is complete and intact.

---

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“He waited yet another seven days…”**

- Continues the **sacred weekly rhythm** — this is the **third release**, spaced **seven days apart** each time (cf. vv. 8–10).
    

> The repeated intervals imply both **patience** and **faith in divine timing** — not acting prematurely.

---

**“He sent out the dove…”**

- The same dove — the one that brought the **olive leaf** (v. 11). This time, she is sent to determine whether the **earth is livable**.
    

---

**“And she did not return to him again” (וְלֹא־יָסְפָה שׁוּב אֵלָיו עוֹד)**

- Literally: **“she did not continue to return to him anymore”**
    
- **יָסְפָה (yasfah)** — to add, continue, proceed
    
    > This intensifies the finality: the dove had **no more reason** to return.
    
- This signals:
    
    - **Dry ground available**
        
    - **Sufficient resources for life**
        
    - The **end of dependence** on the ark as exclusive refuge
        

> It’s a **silent approval** from the natural world — the covenantal remnant can soon reenter creation.

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Many read this simply as “the dove found dry ground,” but the text is more than environmental:
    
    - It shows a **progressive testing of readiness**
        
    - It marks a **pivot in authority** — from ark-based survival to land-based restoration
        

> The dove’s disappearance marks the **end of one age** and the **invitation to begin another**.

---

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

- ~**Day 307–314**, AM 1656
    
- This is the **final test** before the ground is revealed to be dry (v. 13) and before YHWH speaks again (v. 15)

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And he stayed yet other seven days; and sent forth the dove; which returned not again unto him any more.”

**YLT:**  
“And he stayeth yet other seven days, and sendeth forth the dove, and it added not to turn back unto him any more.”

**NIV:**  
“He waited seven more days and sent the dove out again, but this time it did not return to him.”

> All translations match. YLT best preserves the **“added not”** intensifier (from יָסְפָה). NIV paraphrases gently.

---

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

- **Matthew 10:16** — “Be wise as serpents, and harmless as doves” — wisdom + peace in testing unknown ground.
    
- **Psalm 74:19** — “Deliver not the soul of your dove to the wild beasts” — Israel often symbolized as a dove in exile.
    
- **Hosea 11:11** — “They will come trembling like birds from Egypt, like doves from Assyria…” — **return from judgment to rest**.
    

> Genesis 8:12 concludes Noaḥ’s observation phase. The dove's absence confirms that the **curse is lifting**, and the earth, though scarred, is ready for life again.
