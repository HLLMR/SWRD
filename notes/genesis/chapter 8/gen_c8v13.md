### **GENESIS 8:13**

_Scroll of Noaḥ_  
(Traditional Genesis 8:13)  
**The Earth Is Drying**

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And it came to pass in the six hundred and first year, in the first month, on the first of the month, that the waters were dried from off the earth. And Noaḥ removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and behold — the surface of the ground was dry.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וַיְהִי בְּאַחַת וְשֵׁשׁ־מֵאוֹת שָׁנָה  
בָּרִאשׁוֹן בְּאֶחָד לַחֹדֶשׁ  
חָרְבוּ הַמַּיִם מֵעַל הָאָרֶץ  
וַיָּסַר נֹחַ אֶת־מִכְסֵה הַתֵּבָה  
וַיַּרְא וְהִנֵּה חָרְבוּ פְנֵי הָאֲדָמָה

---

#### Transliteration:

_Vayehi be’aḥat ve’shesh-me’ot shanah,  
ba’rishon be’echad laḥodesh,  
ḥarvu hamayim meʿal ha’aretz;  
vayyasar Noaḥ et-mikhseh hatevah,  
vayyar, ve’hineh — ḥarvu penei ha’adamah._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And it came to pass in the six hundred and first year, in the first month, on the first of the month, the water subsided from off the earth; and Noah opened the covering of the ark which he had made, and saw that the water had subsided from the face of the ground.”

> The LXX matches closely, emphasizing that **Noaḥ observes before acting**, confirming what the dove’s absence had implied.

---

#### DSS (4QGen):

Confirms MT. The key phrase **“removed the covering”** (וַיָּסַר ... מִכְסֵה) and **dry ground visible** is intact.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“In the six hundred and first year…”**

- Of Noaḥ’s life (cf. Genesis 7:11)
    
- **1st day of the 1st month** = **New Year’s Day** in the Hebrew reckoning
    
    > A deliberate **reset** — **new year, new world**
    

> This marks **exactly 314 days** since the Flood began.

---

**“The waters were dried from off the earth” (חָרְבוּ הַמַּיִם)**

- **חָרַב (ḥarav)** — to dry up, be parched — used for both land and judgment
    
    > The earth is now **no longer covered**, though not yet fully restored (see v. 14)
    

---

**“Noaḥ removed the covering of the ark…”**

- Hebrew: **מִכְסֵה (mikhseh)** — covering, canopy, overlay
    
    > May refer to the roof or upper hatch; this is the **first time Noaḥ fully opens the structure**
    

> It’s a moment of **unveiling** — the transition from protection to preparation.

---

**“He looked, and behold — the surface of the ground was dry”**

- **וַיַּרְא וְהִנֵּה (vayyar, ve’hineh)** — emphatic Hebrew construction: **he saw — and lo!**
    
- **פְנֵי הָאֲדָמָה (penei ha’adamah)** — the **face of the ground**, the same phrase used at the creation of man (Genesis 2:7)
    

> The world that was **erased** (7:23) is now **re-exposed**. This is **re-creation in progress**.

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Often, the Flood narrative is rushed at this point — but the text is **precise with dates and detail**:
    
    - **Noaḥ observes** before leaving
        
    - He acts in **obedience and patience**, not assumption
        

> This is a model for **post-judgment discernment**: **don’t move until the ground is truly ready**.

---

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

- **1st day of the 1st month, AM 1657**
    
- **314 days** since the Flood began (Genesis 7:11)
    
- **~2.5 months** before YHWH commands exit (v. 15–16)

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And it came to pass… the waters were dried up… and Noah removed the covering… and looked, and behold, the face of the ground was dry.”

**YLT:**  
“And it cometh to pass… the waters have dried from off the earth, and Noah turneth aside the covering… and looketh, and lo, the face of the ground hath become dry.”

**NIV:**  
“By the first day of the first month… the water had dried up… Noah then removed the covering… and saw that the surface of the ground was dry.”

> All agree on the sequence. KJV and YLT preserve more **Hebraic structure**, especially the “and behold.”

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

- **Exodus 12:2** — “This month shall be unto you the beginning of months…” — divine cycles of redemption often start at the **1st day of the 1st month**
    
- **Isaiah 25:7** — “He will destroy the covering that is cast over all people…” — echoes of the ark’s canopy being removed
    
- **Romans 8:19–21** — “The creation waits for the revealing…” — here, **the earth waits to reveal itself** once more to humanity
    

> Genesis 8:13 is the **first human glimpse of restored earth** — a visual confirmation that the **season of wrath is giving way to the season of rebirth**.
