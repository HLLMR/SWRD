#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And the waters continued to decrease until the tenth month; in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, the tops of the mountains were seen.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וְהַמַּיִם הָיוּ הָלוֹךְ וְחָסוֹר  
עַד־הַחֹדֶשׁ הָעֲשִׂירִי  
בָּעֲשִׂירִי בְּאֶחָד לַחֹדֶשׁ  
נִרְאוּ רָאשֵׁי הֶהָרִים

---

#### Transliteration:

_Ve’hamayim hayu halokh ve’ḥasor  
ʿad haḥodesh haʿasiri —  
baʿasiri, be’echad laḥodesh  
nir’u roshei he’harim._

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And the waters continued to decrease until the tenth month; and in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, the heads of the mountains were seen.”

> The LXX affirms the slow, measured return of visibility — emphasizing **progressive revelation** after judgment.

---

#### DSS (4QGen):

No variation from MT. The phrase **“the tops of the mountains were seen”** is preserved, confirming the sequence of recession.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“The waters continued to decrease…” (הָלוֹךְ וְחָסוֹר)**

- **Halokh ve’ḥasor** — literally: “going and diminishing,” a Hebrew idiom denoting **gradual, progressive change**
    

> This language continues the **orderly reversal** of judgment: nothing is chaotic or abrupt — **YHWH is still governing nature step by step**.

---

**“Until the tenth month…”**

- From the ark’s landing on **17th of the 7th month**, this represents **2.5 months later**.
    
- By the **1st day of the 10th month**, the floodwaters had receded enough for **mountaintops to become visible**.
    

> Creation is reappearing — not by miracle, but by **measured mercy**.

---

**“The tops of the mountains were seen” (נִרְאוּ רָאשֵׁי הֶהָרִים)**

- First visual sign of hope: land returns to sight.
    

> This mirrors **Genesis 1:9–10**, when land emerged from beneath the waters at creation.

> It also sets the stage for **Noaḥ’s future sending of the birds** (vv. 6–12), showing he is watching the environment patiently.

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Some oversimplify the Flood narrative as “40 days and done,” but this verse is a **timestamped log** of **months of gradual change**.
    

> The text demands a **detailed understanding of divine process**, not just symbolic interpretation.

---

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

- **1st day of the 10th month, AM 1656**
    
- ~73 days since the ark came to rest (Genesis 8:4)
    
- ~253 days since the Flood began (Genesis 7:11)

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month: in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, were the tops of the mountains seen.”

**YLT:**  
“And the waters have been going and becoming lacking till the tenth month; in the tenth, on the first of the month, appeared the heads of the mountains.”

**NIV:**  
“The waters continued to recede until the tenth month, and on the first day of the tenth month the tops of the mountains became visible.”

> All convey the meaning. KJV and YLT preserve the **poetic motion** of “going and decreasing”; NIV simplifies to “receding.”

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

- **Genesis 1:9** — “Let the dry land appear…” — this is the **restoration of what was once covered**.
    
- **Deuteronomy 34:1** — “Moses went up to Mount Nebo and saw the land…” — **seeing from high ground** is often the first glimpse of promised hope.
    
- **Habakkuk 3:6** — “He stood and measured the earth: He looked and shook the nations: the everlasting mountains were scattered…” — mountains as symbols of enduring witness.
    

> Genesis 8:5 marks the moment **vision returns** — the world, once drowned and hidden, begins to emerge. The eye of man will soon see what was covered by wrath.
