### **GENESIS 8:22**

_Scroll of Noaḥ_  
(Traditional Genesis 8:22)  
**Covenant with the Earth: Seasons Shall Not Cease**

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**While the earth remains, seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, day and night — shall not cease.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

עֹד כָּל־יְמֵי הָאָרֶץ  
זֶרַע וְקָצִיר  
וְקֹר וָחֹם  
וְקַיִץ וָחֹרֶף  
וְיוֹם וָלַיְלָה  
לֹא יִשְׁבֹּתוּ

---

#### Transliteration:

_ʿOd kol yemei ha’aretz —  
zeraʿ ve’qatzir,  
veqor vaḥom,  
veqayitz vaḥoref,  
veyom valaylah —  
lo yishbotu._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“All the days of the earth, seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer and spring, day and night — shall not cease.”

> LXX has **“spring” (ἔαρ)** where MT has **“winter” (חֹרֶף)** — likely a scribal or regional seasonal reversal. MT is supported by DSS.

---

#### DSS (4QGen):

Aligns with MT. Preserves full sequence and confirms **winter** (חֹרֶף) rather than **spring**.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“While the earth remains…” (עֹד כָּל־יְמֵי הָאָרֶץ)**

- Hebrew literally: **“as long as the days of the earth endure”**
    

> This introduces a **conditional permanence** — not infinite, but **until a known end**, the current world order is guaranteed.

---

**“Seedtime and harvest… cold and heat… summer and winter… day and night”**

- Four pairs describing **agricultural, environmental, and cosmic cycles**
    
- **Oppositional pairs** emphasize **ordered rhythm**, not chaos:
    
    - Work and reward (planting/harvesting)
        
    - Environmental polarity (cold/heat)
        
    - Seasonal transition (summer/winter)
        
    - Temporal order (day/night)
        

> Creation is re-established as **predictable, stable, life-supporting**.

---

**“Shall not cease” (לֹא יִשְׁבֹּתוּ)**

- **שָׁבַת (shavat)** — to cease, rest, stop
    

> From this root we get **Shabbat** — here, used to mean: **these cycles will not rest**

> The world will **continue in ordered motion**, preserving conditions for human and animal life.

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Some claim Genesis presents a young, unchanging Earth — but this verse affirms **temporal boundaries**: as long as the earth remains, **seasons will persist**.
    

> This is the **first ecological covenant**, promising **ongoing provision and predictability** in nature.

---

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

- **Late 2nd month, AM 1657**
    
- Immediately following YHWH’s vow (v. 21) in response to Noaḥ’s altar (v. 20)

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest… shall not cease.”

**YLT:**  
“During all days of the earth — seed-time and harvest… day and night — do not cease.”

**NIV:**  
“As long as the earth endures, seedtime and harvest… will never cease.”

> All versions express stability. YLT retains **“during all days of the earth”**, closer to Hebrew nuance.

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

- **Genesis 1:14** — “Let there be lights… for signs, and for seasons…” — established rhythms now **reaffirmed**
    
- **Ecclesiastes 3:1–8** — “To everything there is a season…” — mirrors these pairs of time
    
- **Revelation 22:2** — tree of life bearing fruit **every month** — even in eternity, **rhythmic cycles of abundance** are preserved
    

> Genesis 8:22 is YHWH’s **first covenantal promise to the earth itself**: **as long as the world endures, creation will remain fruitful, ordered, and dependable**.
