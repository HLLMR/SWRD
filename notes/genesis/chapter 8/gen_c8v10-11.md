### **GENESIS 8:10–11**

_Scroll of Noaḥ_  
(Traditional Genesis 8:10–11)  
**The Olive Leaf of Peace**

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**10.** And he waited yet another seven days, and again he sent out the dove from the ark.  
**11.** And the dove came in to him at evening, and behold, in her mouth was a freshly plucked olive leaf. So Noaḥ knew that the waters had abated from off the earth.

#### Hebrew (MT):

**10**  
וַיָּחֶל עוֹד שִׁבְעַת יָמִים אֲחֵרִים  
וַיֹּסֶף שַׁלַּח אֶת־הַיּוֹנָה מִן־הַתֵּבָה

**11**  
וַתָּבֹא אֵלָיו הַיּוֹנָה לְעֵת עֶרֶב  
וְהִנֵּה עֲלֵה־זַיִת טָרָף בְּפִיהָ  
וַיֵּדַע נֹחַ  
כִּי קַלּוּ הַמַּיִם מֵעַל הָאָרֶץ

#### Transliteration:

**10**  
_Vayyachel ʿod shivʿat yamim acheirim,  
vayyosef shallaḥ et-hayyona min-hatevah._

**11**  
_Vattavo elav hayona leʿet ʿerev,  
vehineh ʿalei-zayit taraf befihah,  
vayyedaʿ Noaḥ  
ki kallu hamayim meʿal ha’aretz._

#### LXX (Brenton):

**10.** “And having waited yet seven other days, he again sent forth the dove from the ark.”  
**11.** “And the dove returned to him in the evening, and had a leaf of olive, a sprig in her mouth; and Noah knew that the water had ceased from the earth.”

> The LXX closely follows the MT. “A sprig” or “fresh leaf” (Greek: φύλλον ἐλαίας κατάκαρπον) emphasizes **freshness and life**.

---

#### DSS (4QGen):

Fully consistent with MT — especially preserves the key phrase **“olive leaf freshly plucked”** (עֲלֵה־זַיִת טָרָף), indicating the **renewal of plant life**.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**Verse 10 — “He waited another seven days…”**

- Noaḥ demonstrates **disciplined patience** — he’s not rushing out, but waiting on **clear signs** of YHWH’s timing.
    
- **שִׁבְעַת יָמִים אֲחֵרִים (shivʿat yamim acheirim)** — “another seven days” — reinforces a **rhythm of weeks**, likely sabbatical in origin.
    

---

**“He again sent out the dove…”**

- Not the raven — not even the first dove. This time, he sends **with new expectation**, now that mountaintops have appeared (v. 5) and the raven has long gone (v. 7).
    

---

**Verse 11 — “The dove came in to him at evening…”**

- **לְעֵת עֶרֶב (leʿet ʿerev)** — evening = **end of a day, close of a watch**, time of reflection and peace.
    

> The return of the dove with evidence marks the **first real turning point** in visible re-creation.

---

**“Behold, a freshly plucked olive leaf…” (עֲלֵה־זַיִת טָרָף)**

- **טָרָף (taraf)** — “freshly torn” — not dead debris, but **a green sign of life**
    
- **Olive trees** are hardy, often among the first to regrow in disturbed soil — common in ancient Near East hills.
    

> The **olive leaf** has become the enduring **symbol of peace and restoration** — rooted right here.

---

**“So Noaḥ knew…”**

- **וַיֵּדַע נֹחַ (vayyedaʿ Noaḥ)** — Noaḥ “knew” — he **discerns by sign**, not assumption.
    

> Faithful stewardship requires evidence — Noaḥ is not guided by emotion but by **confirmation**.

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Popular retellings often sentimentalize the olive leaf — but the text presents it as **hard-won evidence** of a slowly healing world.
    

> This is not symbolic optimism — it’s a **measured revelation** of divine mercy returning to the earth.

---

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

- ~**Day 300–307**, likely **first week of the 11th month**, AM 1656
    
- Second bird mission, **14 days after raven**, **7 days after first dove mission**

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
10. “And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth the dove…”  
11. “And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf pluckt off…”

**YLT:**  
10. “And he stayeth yet other seven days, and addeth to send forth the dove…”  
11. “And the dove cometh in unto him at even-time, and lo, an olive leaf torn off in her mouth…”

**NIV:**  
10. “He waited seven more days and again sent out the dove…”  
11. “When the dove returned to him in the evening, there in its beak was a freshly plucked olive leaf…”

> All versions align. KJV and YLT preserve poetic gravity. NIV emphasizes modern clarity.

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

- **Psalm 52:8** — “I am like a green olive tree in the house of God…” — the **olive = life rooted in covenant**.
    
- **Zechariah 4:3** — olive trees by the lampstand — symbols of **prophetic anointing and restoration**.
    
- **Romans 11:17** — Gentiles grafted into the **olive tree of Israel** — continuity of **life from the root**.
    

> Genesis 8:10–11 shows that **life has returned**, not just physically but **covenantally** — peace is possible again, and man is preparing to walk the earth.
