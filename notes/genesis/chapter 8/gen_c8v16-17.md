### **GENESIS 8:16–17**

_Scroll of Noaḥ_  
(Traditional Genesis 8:16–17)  
**“Go Forth… Be Fruitful”**

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**16.** “Go out from the ark — you, and your wife, and your sons, and your sons’ wives with you.  
**17.** Bring out with you every living thing of all flesh that is with you — of birds and of beasts and of every creeping thing that creeps upon the earth — so that they may swarm in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth.”

#### Hebrew (MT):

**16**  
צֵא מִן־הַתֵּבָה  
אַתָּה וְאִשְׁתְּךָ  
וּבָנֶיךָ וּנְשֵׁי בָנֶיךָ אִתָּךְ

**17**  
כָּל־הַחַיָּה אֲשֶׁר אִתְּךָ  
מִכָּל בָּשָׂר בָּעוֹף וּבַבְּהֵמָה  
וּבְכָל הָרֶמֶשׂ הָרֹמֵשׂ עַל־הָאָרֶץ  
הוֹצֵא אִתָּךְ  
וְשָׁרְצוּ בָאָרֶץ  
וּפָרוּ וְרָבוּ עַל־הָאָרֶץ

#### Transliteration:

**16**  
_Tze min-hatevah,  
attah ve’ishtekha,  
u’vaneikha u’neshei vaneikha itakha._

**17**  
_Kol haḥayyah asher itekha  
mikkol basar — baʿof u’vab’hemah  
u’ve’khol haremes haromes ʿal ha’aretz —  
hotze itakha,  
ve’shar’tzu va’aretz,  
u’faru ve’ravu ʿal ha’aretz._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

**16.** “Come out from the ark, you and your wife and your sons and your sons’ wives with you.  
**17.** And all the wild beasts that are with you, and all flesh both of birds and beasts and reptiles creeping on the earth — bring them out with you; and increase and multiply upon the earth.”

> LXX aligns in structure and command — “increase and multiply” mirrors the **original Genesis blessing**.

---

#### DSS (4QGen):

Faithfully preserves MT structure. The command to **exit**, followed by the command to **multiply**, appears intact.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**Verse 16 — “Go out from the ark…”**

- **צֵא (tze)** — imperative: **go forth**, the same root used in divine sending (cf. Genesis 12:1)
    
- This is **Noaḥ’s release from judgment** — but only after divine approval.
    

> Note: all **eight souls** (cf. Genesis 7:13) are listed again — the remnant is intact.

---

**Verse 17 — “Bring out every living thing…”**

- Not just Noaḥ’s family — but **the whole remnant of creation** is commanded to **reenter the world**
    
- The wording closely mirrors **Genesis 1:22 & 1:28**:
    
    - **“Be fruitful and multiply”**
        
    - **“Swarm upon the earth”**
        

> This is the **formal reissuance of the Creation Mandate** — life is to spread out and fill the earth anew.

---

**“Creeping things that creep” (הָרֶמֶשׂ הָרֹמֵשׂ)**

- Repetitive form emphasizes **the smallest, humblest lifeforms** — nothing is excluded from the restoration command.
    

---

**“That they may swarm… be fruitful… and multiply”**

- Hebrew:
    
    - **וְשָׁרְצוּ (ve’sharetzu)** — swarm, teem
        
    - **וּפָרוּ (u’faru)** — bear fruit
        
    - **וְרָבוּ (ve’ravu)** — multiply, grow numerous
        

> Identical to **Genesis 1:20–22** — this is **a second creation**, not symbolic, but literal.

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Many fail to realize this is not just permission — it is a **mandate**:
    
    - Life must not remain cloistered.
        
    - The ark was temporary; **dominion requires dispersion**.
        

> Noaḥ is not merely a survivor — he is the **priest and steward of a restarted creation**.

---

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

- **27th day of 2nd month, AM 1657**
    
- This command is given the **same day the earth is declared fully dry** (v. 14)

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
16. “Go forth of the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons’ wives with thee.”  
17. “Bring forth with thee every living thing… that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply…”

**YLT:**  
16. “Go out from the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons’ wives with thee;”  
17. “Every living thing that [is] with thee… bring out with thee, and they have teemed in the earth, and been fruitful, and have multiplied…”

**NIV:**  
16. “Come out of the ark, you and your wife and your sons and their wives.”  
17. “Bring out every kind of living creature… so they can multiply on the earth and be fruitful and increase…”

> All translations carry the intent. KJV/YLT best preserve the **formal tone of command**. NIV is readable but compresses the richness of the Hebrew verbs.

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

- **Genesis 1:22, 28** — original command to fill the earth is now renewed.
    
- **Isaiah 45:18** — “He did not create it to be empty, but formed it to be inhabited.”
    
- **Acts 17:26** — “He made from one blood all nations… to dwell on all the face of the earth.”
    

> Genesis 8:16–17 marks the **second exodus** — not from Egypt, but from judgment — and life is called again to **fill the world by divine decree**.
