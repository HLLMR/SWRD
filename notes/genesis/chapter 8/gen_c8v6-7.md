### **GENESIS 8:6–7**

_Scroll of Noaḥ_  
(Traditional Genesis 8:6–7)  
**The Raven Sent Forth**

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**6.** And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noaḥ opened the window of the ark which he had made.  
**7.** And he sent forth a raven, and it went out, going to and fro, until the waters were dried up from off the earth.

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

**6**  
וַיְהִי מִקֵּץ אַרְבָּעִים יוֹם  
וַיִּפְתַּח נֹחַ  
אֵת חַלּוֹן הַתֵּבָה  
אֲשֶׁר עָשָׂה

**7**  
וַיְשַׁלַּח אֶת־הָעֹרֵב  
וַיֵּצֵא יָצוֹא וָשׁוֹב  
עַד־יְבֹשֶׁת הַמַּיִם  
מֵעַל הָאָרֶץ

#### Transliteration:

**6**  
_Vayehi miqqetz arbaʿim yom,  
vayiftach Noaḥ  
et ḥallon hatevah  
asher ʿasah._

**7**  
_Vayyishallaḥ et-haʿorev,  
vayetze yatzo va’shov  
ʿad yivoshet hammayim  
meʿal ha’aretz._

#### LXX (Brenton):

**6.** “And it came to pass after forty days, Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made.  
**7.** And he sent forth a raven, and it went out, and returned not until the water was dried from the earth.”

> LXX omits “to and fro” (יָצוֹא וָשׁוֹב), simplifying the behavior of the raven, but the MT captures its **restless circling**.

---

#### DSS (4QGen):

Consistent with MT. The structure and sequence of **window → raven → testing** is clearly preserved.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**Verse 6 — “At the end of forty days…”**

- Likely **forty days after mountaintops became visible** (v. 5), not after the initial 150 days.
    

> This brings us roughly to **Day ~293 of the Flood**, or **AM 1656, around the 11th month**.

---

**“Noaḥ opened the window…”**

- Hebrew: **חַלּוֹן (ḥallon)** — window, aperture, lattice — same word used in **Genesis 6:16**
    

> Noaḥ acts **deliberately, not presumptuously** — he waits for visibility, then tests further.

---

**Verse 7 — “He sent forth the raven…”**

- **עֹרֵב (ʿorev)** — raven: a scavenger, unclean bird (cf. Leviticus 11:15)
    

> Ravens are hardy, opportunistic — can feed on carcasses and perch on flotsam. They don’t need dry ground to survive.

---

**“And it went out, going to and fro…” (יָצוֹא וָשׁוֹב)**

- A Hebrew idiom: **“back and forth, restlessly”** — suggesting it did **not return to the ark**, but also **didn’t find full rest**.
    

> It likely circled above the waters, feeding on the dead — a grim **reminder of the world outside**.

---

**“Until the waters were dried up from off the earth”**

- The raven does not come back, but **its continued circling signals the flood's slow decline**, not its completion.
    

> Noaḥ sends the raven to gather data — but its behavior is **inconclusive** for human reentry.

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Some treat the raven and dove as mere metaphors or fables, but the text treats them as **real tests of environment**, part of **Noaḥ’s observational wisdom**.
    

> This is **early scientific method** — Noaḥ is not guessing, he’s evaluating.

---

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

- **~Day 293**, approximately **11th month, AM 1656**
    
- 40 days after mountaintops seen (v. 5), months after the ark rested (v. 4), and roughly **two-thirds through the Flood year**.

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
6. “And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window…”  
7. “And he sent forth a raven, which went forth to and fro, until the waters were dried up…”

**YLT:**  
6. “And it cometh to pass, at the end of forty days, that Noah openeth the window…”  
7. “And he sendeth forth the raven, and it goeth out, going out and turning back…”

**NIV:**  
6. “After forty days Noah opened a window…”  
7. “He sent out a raven, and it kept flying back and forth until the water had dried up…”

> KJV and YLT preserve the poetic repetition. NIV clarifies the raven’s erratic behavior but smooths the literal phrasing.

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

- **Leviticus 11:15** — ravens listed among unclean birds; yet used by YHWH in **1 Kings 17:6** to feed Elijah — a creature of paradox.
    
- **Job 38:41** — “Who provides for the raven its prey?” — even scavengers depend on divine provision.
    
- **Luke 12:24** — “Consider the ravens…” — Yeshua uses ravens as a symbol of **trust in divine care**.
    

> Genesis 8:6–7 is Noaḥ’s first act of **discernment** — the raven is his probe into a half-healed world, circling the edge of death.
