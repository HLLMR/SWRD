**14**  
וּבַחֹדֶשׁ הַשֵּׁנִי  
בְּשִׁבְעָה וְעֶשְׂרִים יוֹם לַחֹדֶשׁ  
יָבְשָׁה הָאָרֶץ

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**Verse 14 — “In the second month, on the twenty-seventh day…”**

- Exactly **1 year and 10 days** since the Flood began (cf. Genesis 7:11 — 17th day of 2nd month, AM 1656)
    

> Now: **27th day of 2nd month, AM 1657**

- The text distinguishes between:
    
    - **Verse 13** — surface dryness (חָרְבוּ)
        
    - **Verse 14** — complete dryness (יָבְשָׁה), suitable for habitation
        

> This marks **full restoration** — earth is now habitable again.

---

**“The earth was dry” (יָבְשָׁה הָאָרֶץ)**

- Hebrew: **yaveshah** — parched, completely dry; different from earlier “drained” (ḥarvu) or “subsided” (kallu)
    

> This final descriptor indicates that even **moisture saturation is gone** — it’s time to begin anew.

---

**Verse 15 — “And Elohim spoke to Noaḥ…”**

- Only now — after full dryness and visible confirmation — does YHWH **initiate dialogue**
    

> The ark is not exited by instinct or convenience — but by **obedient response to divine word**

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Some assume Noaḥ left the ark as soon as it looked safe (v. 13), but he waits **over a month** for YHWH’s instruction.
    

> Noaḥ models **submissive leadership** — even after receiving visual evidence, he does **not move without the voice of Elohim**.

---

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

- **27th day of the 2nd month, AM 1657**
    
- **Exact duration of the Flood year: 1 year + 10 days**

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
14. “And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day… was the earth dried.”  
15. “And God spake unto Noah, saying,”

**YLT:**  
14. “And in the second month, in the seven and twentieth day… the earth hath become dry.”  
15. “And God speaketh unto Noah, saying,”

**NIV:**  
14. “By the twenty-seventh day of the second month the earth was completely dry.”  
15. “Then God said to Noah,”

> KJV and YLT reflect the formality of divine pause and command. NIV smooths for readability.

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

- **Exodus 40:2,17** — tabernacle set up on **first day of the first month**, linking **flood’s end and worship’s beginning**
    
- **Isaiah 54:9** — “As in the days of Noaḥ… never again will I flood the earth…” — divine promise flows from this very moment
    
- **Genesis 12:1** — “Now YHWH said to Abram…” — a **new world begins with a divine call**
    

> Genesis 8:14–15 is not just about geography — it’s about **authorization**. Noaḥ will only exit when the Creator who judged the world **invites him to step into the new one**.
