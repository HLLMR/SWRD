### **GENESIS 8:18–19**

_Scroll of Noaḥ_  
(Traditional Genesis 8:18–19)  
**The Exit from the Ark**

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**18.** So Noaḥ went out, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons’ wives with him.  
**19.** Every beast, every creeping thing, and every bird — everything that moves upon the earth — went out from the ark by their families.

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

**18**  
וַיֵּצֵא נֹחַ  
וּבָנָיו וְאִשְׁתּוֹ  
וּנְשֵׁי בָנָיו אִתּוֹ

**19**  
כָּל־הַחַיָּה  
כָּל־הָרֶמֶשׂ  
וְכָל־הָעוֹף  
כֹּל רוֹמֵשׂ עַל־הָאָרֶץ  
לְמִשְׁפְּחֹתֵיהֶם  
יָצְאוּ מִן־הַתֵּבָה

---

#### Transliteration:

**18**  
_Vayetze Noaḥ,  
u’vanav ve’ishto,  
u’neshei vanav ito._

**19**  
_Kol haḥayyah,  
kol haremes,  
ve’khol haʿof,  
kol romes ʿal ha’aretz —  
le’mishpeḥoteihem,  
yatze’u min-hatevah._

#### LXX (Brenton):

**18.** “And Noah went forth, and his wife, and his sons, and his sons’ wives with him.  
**19.** And all the beasts, and all the reptiles, and all the birds — all that moves upon the earth — went forth from the ark by their kindreds.”

> LXX renders “families” as “kindreds” — matching the Genesis 1 categories of life **reproducing after their kind**.

---

#### DSS (4QGen):

Fully consistent with MT — **order, repetition, and taxonomy** of life is intact.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**Verse 18 — “So Noaḥ went out…”**

- First time humanity steps back onto earth **since the judgment began (Genesis 7:13)**
    
- **Eight souls exit** — same group that entered (cf. 1 Peter 3:20)
    

> Obedience is complete. Noaḥ **waited for YHWH’s word** and now **acts immediately**.

---

**Verse 19 — “Every beast… every creeping thing… every bird…”**

- Repetition of creation categories:
    
    - **חַיָּה (ḥayyah)** — wild animals
        
    - **רֶמֶשׂ (remes)** — creeping things
        
    - **עוֹף (ʿof)** — flying things
        

> The order here **mirrors Genesis 1**, reaffirming this as a **second creation launch**.

---

**“Everything that moves upon the earth”**

- **רוֹמֵשׂ (romes)** — moving, crawling, wriggling
    

> Nothing is forgotten. Every nephesh-bearing land creature exits.

---

**“By their families” (לְמִשְׁפְּחֹתֵיהֶם)**

- **Mishpeḥot** — families, clans, kin-groups
    

> This is the **first appearance of “family” in the post-Flood world** — signaling the restart of **social, genetic, and covenantal lines**.

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Some treat this as mere logistics, but the **order and structure** of this exit reflect **YHWH’s intentional design** — echoing **Genesis 1, 2, and 6**.
    

> This is not survival. This is **recommissioning**.

---

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

- **27th day of 2nd month, AM 1657**
    
- Exact same day YHWH gave the command (v. 15–16) — showing **immediate obedience**

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
18. “And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons’ wives with him.”  
19. “Every beast, every creeping thing, and every fowl… after their kinds, went forth out of the ark.”

**YLT:**  
18. “And Noah goeth out, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons’ wives with him;”  
19. “Every living thing, every creeping thing, and every fowl… by their families they have gone out from the ark.”

**NIV:**  
18. “So Noah came out, together with his sons and his wife and his sons’ wives.”  
19. “All the animals and all the creatures that move along the ground and all the birds… came out of the ark, one kind after another.”

> KJV and YLT maintain strong taxonomic structure. NIV simplifies but retains the essential idea.

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

- **Genesis 1:24–25** — “Let the earth bring forth living creatures… after their kind” — creation’s categories **return to action**.
    
- **Genesis 9:19** — “From these the whole earth was populated” — this exit is the seed of all post-Flood humanity and life.
    
- **Revelation 21:5** — “Behold, I make all things new” — the pattern of **judgment followed by ordered renewal** begins here.
    

> Genesis 8:18–19 is the first step into the **new age of mankind**. The ark has served its purpose — now, **the world must be re-filled**.
