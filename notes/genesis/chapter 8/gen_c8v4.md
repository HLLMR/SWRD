### **GENESIS 8:4**

_Scroll of Noaḥ_  
(Traditional Genesis 8:4)  
**The Ark Comes to Rest**

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, the ark came to rest upon the mountains of Ararat.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וַתָּנַח הַתֵּבָה  
בַּחֹדֶשׁ הַשְּׁבִיעִי  
בְּשִׁבְעָה עָשָׂר יוֹם לַחֹדֶשׁ  
עַל־הָרֵי אֲרָרָט

---

#### Transliteration:

_Vattanaḥ hatevah  
baḥodesh hasheviʿi,  
be’shivʿah ʿasar yom laḥodesh,  
ʿal harei Ararat._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, on the mountains of Ararat.”

> LXX diverges slightly, listing **“twenty-seventh”** instead of **“seventeenth.”** The MT, supported by DSS and the structured flood chronology, confirms **“seventeenth”** as original.

---

#### DSS (4QGen):

Confirms the MT date — **17th of the 7th month** — reinforcing the structured and purposeful timeline.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“In the seventh month, on the seventeenth day…”**

- This is **exactly five months** (150 days) from the **start of the Flood** (Genesis 7:11: 17th of 2nd month)
    

> The Flood was not random — every key event is **calibrated and dated**, reinforcing **divine control** over judgment and restoration.

---

**“The ark came to rest” (וַתָּנַח)**

- **נּוּחַ (nuach)** — root of **Noaḥ’s name**, meaning “rest,” “settle,” “be at peace”
    

> Poetic and prophetic: **Noaḥ brings rest to creation**, and now the ark **rests** — this is the **Sabbath of the world** after its violent cleansing.

---

**“Upon the mountains of Ararat”**

- Hebrew: **הָרֵי אֲרָרָט (harei Ararat)** — “mountains,” plural
    

> Refers to a **range**, not a single peak (e.g., not strictly modern Mt. Ararat)

- Ararat = **Urartu** (ancient Assyrian kingdom), located in modern eastern Turkey, possibly extending into Armenia and Iran.
    

> The ark doesn’t land on **civilized ground**, but on **high, remote peaks** — setting the stage for a new descent and dispersal.

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Many treat this verse as mythic or irrelevant — yet the exact date, name link (Noaḥ → rest), and geographic specificity make this a **turning point in the flood narrative**.
    

> This is not a drift into calm — it’s a **designed landing**.

---

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**17th day of the 7th month, AM 1656**

- Exactly **150 days from the flood’s start (Genesis 7:11)**
    
- Marks the **end of judgment’s climax** and the beginning of **geographic orientation** for the post-Flood world.

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat.”

**YLT:**  
“And the ark resteth, in the seventh month, in the seventeenth day of the month, on mountains of Ararat.”

**NIV:**  
“On the seventeenth day of the seventh month the ark came to rest on the mountains of Ararat.”

> All are consistent. KJV/YLT preserve the **poetic language of rest** — echoing the theological point.

---

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

- **Genesis 2:2** — “And on the seventh day God rested…” — now the ark rests on the **seventh month**, symbolically evoking **Sabbath themes**.
    
- **Exodus 33:14** — “My presence shall go with thee, and I will give thee rest.”
    
- **Hebrews 4:9–10** — “There remains a Sabbath rest for the people of God…” — Noaḥ’s ark is a **type of eternal refuge**.
    

> Genesis 8:4 is the **first sign of stability** after global chaos — a **quiet place** where the new world waits beneath the waters.
