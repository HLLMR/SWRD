### **GENESIS 8:2–3**

_Scroll of Noaḥ_  
(Traditional Genesis 8:2–3)  
**The Waters Recede**

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**2.** And the fountains of the deep and the windows of the heavens were closed, and the rain from the heavens was restrained.  
**3.** And the waters returned from off the earth, continually receding, and the waters decreased at the end of one hundred and fifty days.

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

**2**  
וַיִּסָּכְרוּ מַעְיְנוֹת תְּהוֹם  
וַאֲרֻבּוֹת הַשָּׁמַיִם  
וַיֵּעָצֶר הַגֶּשֶׁם מִן־הַשָּׁמָיִם

**3**  
וַיָּשָׁבוּ הַמַּיִם מֵעַל הָאָרֶץ  
הָלוֹךְ וָשׁוֹב  
וַיּחַסְרוּ הַמַּיִם  
מִקְצֵה חֲמִשִּׁים וּמְאַת יוֹם

#### Transliteration:

**2**  
_Vayyissakru maʿyenot tehom  
va’arubbot hashamayim,  
vayyeʿatzer haggeshem min hashamayim._

**3**  
_Vayyashuvu hammayim meʿal ha’aretz  
halokh va’shov,  
vayyachasru hammayim  
miqtzeh ḥamishim u’me’at yom._

#### LXX (Brenton):

**2.** “And the fountains of the abyss were closed, and the floodgates of heaven, and the rain from heaven was withheld.  
**3.** And the waters returned from the earth, going and returning, and the waters decreased after one hundred and fifty days.”

> LXX mirrors the MT’s poetic rhythm: “going and returning” is an idiom for **steady process**, not instant cessation.

---

#### DSS (4QGen):

Consistent with MT — the structural flow of closing → restraint → recession is preserved without deviation.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**Verse 2 — “The fountains of the deep and the windows of the heavens were closed…”**

- **מַעְיְנוֹת תְּהוֹם (maʿyenot tehom)** — fountains of the deep
    
- **אֲרֻבּוֹת הַשָּׁמַיִם (arubbot hashamayim)** — floodgates/windows of the heavens
    

> These are the same **dual sources** of the Flood’s onset (Genesis 7:11). Now they are **sealed** by the same divine authority.

- **וַיֵּעָצֶר הַגֶּשֶׁם (vayyeʿatzer haggeshem)** — the rain was **restrained**, not just “stopped”
    

> A deliberate, judicial halt — **YHWH stops the storm** when its work is done.

---

**Verse 3 — “And the waters returned from off the earth…”**

- **וַיָּשָׁבוּ (vayyashuvu)** — returned, withdrew, receded
    
- **הָלוֹךְ וָשׁוֹב (halokh va’shov)** — “going and returning” = **continually receding**, step by step
    

> This is the **inverse of the rising water narrative**. Instead of intensifying, things now **diminish in stages**.

---

**“At the end of 150 days…”**

- **מִקְצֵה (miqtzeh)** — from the extremity/end
    

> Refers back to **Genesis 7:24**, where the waters “prevailed” for 150 days. This marks the **exact reversal point**:  
> • 150 days rising →  
> • 150 days receding →  
> • Then final drying begins

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Some treat the receding as a short process, but the Hebrew emphasizes **gradual withdrawal** over months — not miracle evaporation, but **controlled reversal**.
    

> Just as judgment was **measured**, so too is **restoration**.

---

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

- **End of 150th day = 17th day, 7th month, AM 1656**
    
- We are now entering the **second half of the Flood Year** — the turning tide of history.

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
2. “The fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped, and the rain from heaven was restrained.”  
3. “And the waters returned from off the earth continually: and after the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters were abated.”

**YLT:**  
2. “And closed are fountains of the deep and the net-work of the heavens, and restrained is the shower from the heavens.”  
3. “And turn back do the waters from off the earth, going on and returning, and the waters lack — at the end of the hundred and fifty days.”

**NIV:**  
2. “Now the springs of the deep and the floodgates of the heavens had been closed, and the rain had stopped falling from the sky.”  
3. “The water receded steadily from the earth. At the end of the hundred and fifty days the water had gone down.”

> KJV and YLT preserve the **poetic phrasing**. NIV emphasizes steady process but misses some of the structural repetition.

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

- **Genesis 1:9–10** — the **re-emergence of dry land** is beginning — a **mirror of creation**.
    
- **Exodus 14:26–28** — waters recede to restore Israel’s path; **judgment reverses for the faithful**.
    
- **Psalm 104:7–9** — “At Your rebuke the waters fled…” — a divine command is behind all natural retreat.
    

> Genesis 8:2–3 is the quiet after the storm — the hand of YHWH **retracts the wrath**, and the world prepares for **re-creation**.
