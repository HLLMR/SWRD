### **GENESIS 8:21**

_Scroll of Noaḥ_  
(Traditional Genesis 8:21)  
**YHWH Smells the Offering and Vows Restraint**

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And YHWH smelled a pleasing aroma, and YHWH said in His heart, “I will not again curse the ground because of man, for the imagination of man’s heart is evil from his youth; neither will I again strike every living thing, as I have done.”**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וַיָּרַח יְהוָה אֶת־רֵיחַ הַנִּיחֹחַ  
וַיֹּאמֶר יְהוָה אֶל־לִבּוֹ  
לֹא־אֹסִף לְקַלֵּל עוֹד אֶת־הָאֲדָמָה  
בַּעֲבוּר הָאָדָם  
כִּי יֵצֶר לֵב הָאָדָם רַע מִנְּעֻרָיו  
וְלֹא־אֹסִף עוֹד לְהַכּוֹת אֶת־כָּל־חַי  
כַּאֲשֶׁר עָשִׂיתִי

#### Transliteration:

_Vayyaraḥ YHWH et-rei’aḥ ha’niḥo’aḥ,  
vayyo’mer YHWH el-libbo,  
lo-’osif le’kallel ʿod et-ha’adamah  
baʿavur ha’adam,  
ki yetzer lev ha’adam raʿ mineʿurav,  
ve’lo-’osif ʿod le’hakkot et-kol ḥai  
ka’asher ʿasiti._

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And the Lord God smelled a smell of sweetness, and the Lord God considered, and said, ‘I will not any more curse the earth because of the works of men, for the imagination of man is intently bent upon evil things from his youth; I will not therefore any more smite all living flesh, as I have done.’”

> The LXX matches the MT but adds interpretive nuance: “because of the works of men” = “baʿavur ha’adam”.

---

#### DSS (4QGen):

Fully consistent with MT — especially preserves **“YHWH said in His heart”**, and the declaration **not to curse or destroy again**.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“YHWH smelled a pleasing aroma…” (רֵיחַ הַנִּיחֹחַ)**

- **נִיחֹחַ (niḥo’aḥ)** — from **nuach** (Noaḥ), meaning **rest, soothing, satisfaction**
    

> This is a **covenantal moment**: not manipulation, but **genuine divine response** to heartfelt worship.

---

**“YHWH said in His heart…”**

- Not declared publicly — this is **internal divine deliberation**.
    
    > Mirrors **Genesis 6:6**, when YHWH **regretted in His heart** — now, His heart **resolves to mercy**.
    

---

**“I will not again curse the ground…”**

- **לא־אֹסִף (lo-osif)** — “I will not continue / add again”
    
- **קַלֵּל (kallel)** — to curse, afflict, diminish
    

> Echoes the **curse on the ground** from Genesis 3:17 and 5:29 — that affliction is now **restrained**, not revoked.

---

**“Because the imagination of man’s heart is evil from his youth…”**

- **יֵצֶר לֵב (yetzer lev)** — inclination, forming, shaping of the heart
    

> Same rationale as pre-Flood (Genesis 6:5), but now **mercy is applied despite corruption** — a turning point in divine policy.

---

**“Neither will I strike down all living things again…”**

- This is a **unilateral restraint** — not a promise based on human improvement, but on YHWH’s own **covenantal grace**.
    

> Though man is still fallen, YHWH **limits His judgment** in order to preserve creation’s future.

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Some downplay this as mere symbolism, but the verse is **foundational to God’s post-Flood disposition**:
    
    - It forms the theological base for the **Noaḥic Covenant** in Genesis 9
        
    - It shows that **divine mercy overrides wrath**, without compromising justice

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

- **Late 2nd month, AM 1657**
    
- Immediately after Noaḥ’s offering (v. 20)

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And the LORD smelled a sweet savour… I will not again curse the ground any more for man’s sake… neither will I again smite any more every thing living, as I have done.”

**YLT:**  
“And Jehovah smelleth the sweet fragrance, and Jehovah saith unto His heart, I add not to revile the ground again for man’s sake…”

**NIV:**  
“The LORD smelled the pleasing aroma and said in his heart: ‘Never again will I curse the ground because of humans… nor will I ever again destroy all living creatures, as I have done.’”

> KJV and YLT capture **“said in His heart”** more precisely. NIV paraphrases for modern readability.

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

- **Exodus 34:6–7** — YHWH reveals His nature as “compassionate, gracious… slow to anger…”
    
- **Psalm 103:13–14** — “As a father pities his children… He remembers that we are dust.”
    
- **Romans 5:8** — “While we were yet sinners, Christ died for us…” — divine mercy **preceding merit** begins here.
    

> Genesis 8:21 marks a permanent shift: **divine judgment is now restrained**, not because man improves — but because **YHWH chooses mercy**.
