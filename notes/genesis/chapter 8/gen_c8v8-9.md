### **GENESIS 8:8–9**

_Scroll of Noaḥ_  
(Traditional Genesis 8:8–9)  
**The Dove Finds No Rest**

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**8.** Then he sent out a dove from him, to see whether the waters had abated from the surface of the ground.  
**9.** But the dove found no resting place for the sole of her foot, and she returned to him into the ark, for the waters were still on the face of all the earth. And he stretched out his hand and took her, and brought her in to him into the ark.

#### Hebrew (MT):

**8**  
וַיְשַׁלַּח אֶת־הַיּוֹנָה מֵאִתּוֹ  
לִרְאוֹת הֲקַלּוּ הַמַּיִם  
מֵעַל פְּנֵי הֲאֲדָמָה

**9**  
וְלֹא מָצְאָה הַיּוֹנָה מָנוֹחַ  
לְכַף רַגְלָהּ  
וַתָּשָׁב אֵלָיו אֶל־הַתֵּבָה  
כִּי מַיִם עַל־פְּנֵי כָל־הָאָרֶץ  
וַיִּשְׁלַח יָדוֹ וַיִּקָּחֶהָ  
וַיָּבֵא אֹתָהּ אֵלָיו אֶל־הַתֵּבָה

#### Transliteration:

**8**  
_Vayyishallaḥ et-hayyona me’itto,  
lirot hakallu hammayim  
meʿal penei ha’adamah._

**9**  
_Ve’lo matza’ah hayona mano’aḥ  
le’kaf raglehah;  
vattashav elav el-hatevah,  
ki mayim ʿal penei kol ha’aretz;  
vayyishlaḥ yado vayyiqqaḥehah,  
vayyave otoh elav el-hatevah._

#### LXX (Brenton):

**8.** “And he sent a dove after it, to see if the water had ceased from the face of the earth.”  
**9.** “And the dove, not having found rest for her feet, returned to him into the ark, because there was water on all the face of the earth; and he stretched out his hand and took her in, and brought her into the ark.”

> LXX aligns closely. The sequence of **observation, return, and reacceptance** mirrors the MT.

---

#### DSS (4QGen):

Consistent with MT — **dove’s mission, failure, and return** all intact and structurally emphasized.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**Verse 8 — “He sent out a dove…”**

- **יּוֹנָה (yona)** — dove: a **clean**, gentle, and symbolic bird in Hebrew tradition
    
    - Later used in sacrifices (Leviticus 1:14) and as a **symbol of peace** (cf. Matthew 10:16)
        

> In contrast to the raven (unclean, restless), the dove is **associated with purity and purpose** — a more accurate test for habitability.

---

**“To see if the waters had abated from the surface…”**

- Hebrew: **לִרְאוֹת הֲקַלּוּ הַמַּיִם** — “to see whether the waters had lightened / lessened”
    

> This is a **visual mission** — the dove must **observe and evaluate**, since land was now **partially visible** (cf. v. 5).

---

**Verse 9 — “But the dove found no rest…” (מָנוֹחַ)**

- Same root as **Noaḥ’s name** (נוח) — **rest, settling, peace**
    

> She couldn’t find **Noaḥ** — rest — outside the ark. The world was not yet ready for return.

---

**“And she returned to him… and he took her in”**

- Noaḥ doesn’t leave her — he **reaches out, draws her back, receives her into shelter**
    

> A powerful image of **gentle stewardship**, mirroring how YHWH preserves His remnant.

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Modern readings often miss the symbolic contrast:
    
    - **Raven**: feeds on death, survives in chaos
        
    - **Dove**: seeks life, peace, and cannot rest amid judgment
        

> The dove is not just a data point — it is a **living barometer of restoration readiness**.

---

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

- Likely **1st week of 11th month**, AM 1656
    
- ~7–10 days after raven is sent (Genesis 8:6–7)

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
8. “Also he sent forth a dove… to see if the waters were abated…”  
9. “But the dove found no rest… and she returned… and he put forth his hand, and took her…”

**YLT:**  
8. “And he sendeth forth the dove… to see whether the waters have been lightened…”  
9. “And the dove hath not found rest… and turneth back… and he putteth out his hand…”

**NIV:**  
8. “Then he sent out a dove… to see if the water had receded…”  
9. “But the dove could find nowhere to perch… so it returned… he reached out… and brought it back…”

> All translations agree. KJV and YLT retain Hebrew rhythm. NIV renders the dove’s failure more practically (“nowhere to perch”).

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

- **Psalm 55:6** — “Oh, that I had wings like a dove! I would fly away and be at rest.”
    
    > The dove longs for a resting place — just like humanity under judgment.
    
- **Song of Songs 2:14** — “O my dove… let me see your face…”
    
    > Doves often symbolize **intimacy and tenderness** — echoed here in Noaḥ’s care.
    
- **Matthew 3:16** — “The Spirit of God descending like a dove…”
    
    > The dove becomes the symbol of **new creation**, landing only when **peace is restored**.
    

> Genesis 8:8–9 shows the **first attempt at reentry** — but the world is not yet ready. Only the ark still offers **rest for the weary**.
