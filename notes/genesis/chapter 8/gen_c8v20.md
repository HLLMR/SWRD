### **GENESIS 8:20**

_Scroll of Noaḥ_  
(Traditional Genesis 8:20)  
**Noaḥ Builds an Altar**

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And Noaḥ built an altar to YHWH, and he took of every clean beast and of every clean bird, and offered burnt offerings on the altar.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וַיִּבֶן נֹחַ מִזְבֵּחַ לַיהוָה  
וַיִּקַּח מִכָּל הַבְּהֵמָה הַטְּהוֹרָה  
וּמִכֹּל הָעוֹף הַטָּהוֹר  
וַיַּעַל עֹלוֹת בַּמִּזְבֵּחַ

---

#### Transliteration:

_Vayyiven Noaḥ mizbeaḥ la-YHWH,  
vayyikkaḥ mikol ha’behemah ha’tehorah,  
u’mikkol haʿof ha’tahor,  
vayyaʿal ʿolot ba’mizbeaḥ._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And Noah built an altar to the Lord, and took of all the clean cattle and of all the clean birds, and offered a whole burnt offering upon the altar.”

> The LXX agrees with the MT and clarifies the offering type: **entirely consumed** (Greek: “ὁλοκαυτώματα” = holocaust offerings).

---

#### DSS (4QGen):

Text confirms MT. The terms for **clean animals** and the verb for **whole burnt offerings** are fully preserved.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“Noaḥ built an altar…” (וַיִּבֶן מִזְבֵּחַ)**

- First mention of an **altar** in the Bible.
    
- Noaḥ doesn’t just exit — he **worships**.
    

> This is the **first act of the new world** — not exploration, not farming, but **sacrifice and thanksgiving**.

---

**“To YHWH” (לַיהוָה)**

- Covenant name used. Noaḥ isn’t making a generic religious gesture — he’s responding to the **personal God** who covenanted with him.
    

---

**“He took of every clean beast and clean bird…”**

- Noaḥ had **extra clean animals** (cf. Genesis 7:2–3), not just for food but **for worship**.
    

> Even before Sinai, the concept of **clean vs unclean** was known — evidence of an earlier **moral-sacrificial code**.

---

**“And offered burnt offerings (עֹלוֹת)”**

- **ʿOlot** — whole burnt offerings, fully consumed by fire
    
    > Represents **total surrender, atonement, and devotion** (cf. Leviticus 1)
    
- This was not a **request for favor**, but an **act of reverent gratitude**.
    

> The world has been judged, cleansed, and renewed — and Noaḥ’s response is **worship through sacrifice**.

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Some treat this as a primitive ritual or mythic motif, but the text shows:
    
    - A real altar
        
    - Real offerings
        
    - A covenant God receiving it (see v. 21)
        

> Sacrifice is **not an invention of Mosaic Law** — it is **primordial**, predating Abraham and Moses.

---

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

- **Late 2nd month, AM 1657**
    
- Immediately after exit from the ark (Genesis 8:18–19)
    

> First recorded event of post-Flood human activity is **altar-building and sacrifice**.

---

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And Noah builded an altar unto the LORD… and offered burnt offerings on the altar.”

**YLT:**  
“And Noah buildeth an altar to Jehovah… and causeth burnt-offerings to ascend on the altar.”

**NIV:**  
“Then Noah built an altar to the LORD… he sacrificed burnt offerings on it.”

> KJV and YLT retain more **sacrificial formality**. NIV flattens but conveys the action.

---

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

- **Genesis 4:4** — Abel brought the **firstlings** and was accepted
    
- **Genesis 12:7** — Abram builds an altar after receiving the promise
    
- **Romans 12:1** — “Present your bodies a living sacrifice…” — the pattern of worship by offering begins with Noaḥ
    

> Genesis 8:20 sets the tone: life resumes **only through the fire of offering**. Judgment ends. Covenant begins. And the altar is at the center.
