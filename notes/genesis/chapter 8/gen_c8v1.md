## **GENESIS 8:1**

_Scroll of Noaḥ_  
(Traditional Genesis 8:1)  
**The Turning Point: Mercy Remembers**

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And Elohim remembered Noaḥ, and every living thing, and all the beasts that were with him in the ark. And Elohim caused a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters subsided.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וַיִּזְכֹּר אֱלֹהִים אֶת־נֹחַ  
וְאֵת כָּל־הַחַיָּה  
וְאֵת כָּל־הַבְּהֵמָה  
אֲשֶׁר אִתּוֹ בַּתֵּבָה  
וַיַּעֲבֵר אֱלֹהִים רוּחַ עַל־הָאָרֶץ  
וַיָּשֹׁכּוּ הַמָּיִם

---

#### Transliteration:

_Vayyizkor Elohim et-Noaḥ  
ve’et kol haḥayyah,  
ve’et kol habehemah  
asher ito ba’tevah,  
vayyaʿaver Elohim ruach ʿal ha’aretz,  
vayyashoku hamayim._

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And God remembered Noe, and all the wild beasts, and all the cattle, and all the reptiles that were with him in the ark. And God brought a wind upon the earth, and the water ceased.”

> LXX includes **“reptiles”** (likely from a broader translation of _ḥayyah_), but aligns in meaning and structure — mercy is now **in motion**.

---

#### DSS (4QGen):

Text matches MT. No deviations in the phrasing of “remembered,” “wind,” or the sequence of divine action.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“And Elohim remembered Noaḥ…” (וַיִּזְכֹּר אֱלֹהִים)**

- **זָכַר (zakar)** — to remember, but not passively. In Hebrew, remembrance is **active covenantal engagement**:
    
    - Exodus 2:24 — “God remembered His covenant…”
        
    - 1 Samuel 1:19 — “YHWH remembered Hannah…”
        

> This is the **turning point** of the narrative — not a change in circumstance, but in **divine intention**. Judgment pauses because **covenant is recalled**.

---

**“…and all the living things and the beasts with him in the ark”**

- Noaḥ is not remembered alone. **All life under covenant covering** is included.
    

> This affirms the corporate nature of salvation — **YHWH never forgets even the smallest creature entrusted to His care**.

---

**“And Elohim caused a wind to pass over the earth…”**

- **רוּחַ (ruach)** — wind, spirit, breath. Echoes **Genesis 1:2**, where **the Spirit of God hovered over the waters**.
    

> A poetic parallel: as the **Spirit began creation**, now it begins **re-creation**. The ruach signals both **judgment lifted** and **new life coming**.

---

**“…and the waters subsided” (וַיָּשֹׁכּוּ)**

- **שָׁכַךְ (shakakh)** — to abate, to become still, to subside
    

> Used again in **Esther 2:1**, after wrath passes.

> The chaos of judgment begins to settle. The **God who sends the flood is also the God who calms it**.

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Some downplay “remembered” as mere poetic device. But in Hebrew theology, **“zakar” means action.** It’s the moment **grace reactivates**.
    

> This is not divine forgetfulness — it’s **divine re-engagement** based on covenant timing.

---

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**17th day, 7th month, AM 1656**

- Marks the **end of the 150 days** of prevailing floodwaters (Genesis 7:24), and the beginning of **reversal and restoration**.

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And God remembered Noah, and every living thing… and God made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters assuaged.”

**YLT:**  
“And God remembereth Noah, and every living thing… and God causeth a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters subside.”

**NIV:**  
“But God remembered Noah and all the wild animals… and He sent a wind over the earth, and the waters receded.”

> All are consistent. KJV’s “assuaged” and YLT’s “subside” preserve poetic depth. NIV simplifies but retains meaning.

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

- **Genesis 1:2** — creation by Spirit over the waters; now **restoration** by Spirit over the Flood.
    
- **Exodus 14:21** — wind parts the Red Sea — **ruach** again acts to preserve the remnant.
    
- **Luke 1:72** — “to remember His holy covenant…” — same word, same pattern.
    

> Genesis 8:1 is the **first breath of new creation**. Judgment pauses. Covenant resumes. The ark still floats — but now, so does **hope**.
