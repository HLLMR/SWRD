### **GENESIS 5:15**

_Scroll of the Generations of Adam_  
(Traditional Genesis 5:15)

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And Mahalal’el lived sixty-five years, and begot Yered.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וַיְחִי מַהֲלַלְאֵל  
חָמֵשׁ וְשִׁשִּׁים שָׁנָה  
וַיּוֹלֶד אֶת־יָרֶד

---

#### Transliteration:

_Vayeḥi Mahalal’el  
chamesh ve’shishim shanah,  
vayyoleid et-Yered._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And Maleleel lived one hundred and sixty-five years, and begot Jared.”

> LXX adds **100 years**, continuing its inflation trend and delaying Yered’s generation.

---

#### DSS (4QGen-Exoda):

Affirms MT — **65 years** at the birth of Yered, maintaining chronological consistency.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“Mahalal’el lived sixty-five years…”**

- Lowest fatherhood age yet — reflects the **early maturity and long productivity** of antediluvian life.
    

> Yered’s birth at AM **460** (395 + 65) keeps the **generational cadence intact**, with all patriarchs still overlapping significantly.

**“And begot Yered” (יָרֶד)**

- _Yered_ = “descent” or “shall come down.”
    

> This may **foreshadow the descent of the Watchers** (1 Enoch 6–7) — which some traditions claim happened **in the days of Yered**. Jubilees 4:15–22 explicitly links him to this epoch.

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- The **LXX age inflation** breaks the tight chronological transmission that gives weight to oral Torah, righteous mentorship, and genealogical integrity.
    
- The name _Yered_ is often glossed over, yet his placement in the timeline is **crucial** to understanding the events that lead to **Genesis 6** and the coming judgment.
    

---

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Yered born at AM 460**

- Adam is still alive (dies AM 930), as are Shet, Enosh, Qeynan, and Mahalal’el.
    

> This generation stands at the **edge of a turning point** — when rebellion begins to brew, and the righteous line continues to guard the ways of YHWH.

---

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And Mahalaleel lived sixty and five years, and begat Jared.”

**YLT:**  
“And Mahalaleel liveth five and sixty years, and begetteth Jared.”

**NIV:**  
“When Mahalalel had lived 65 years, he became the father of Jared.”

> All follow MT. KJV/YLT preserve the Hebraic cadence, while NIV modernizes structure but stays faithful in data.

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

**Jubilees 4:14–18** — describes Yered’s birth and hints at his connection to the descent of divine beings.

**1 Enoch 6:6** — lists Yered’s generation as the time when the Watchers descended upon Mount Hermon.

**Luke 3:37** — maintains Mahalal’el and Yered in Messiah’s ancestry.
