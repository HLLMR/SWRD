### **GENESIS 5:9**

_Scroll of the Generations of Adam_  
(Traditional Genesis 5:9)

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And Enosh lived ninety years, and begot Qeynan.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וַיְחִי אֱנוֹשׁ תִּשְׁעִים שָׁנָה  
וַיּוֹלֶד אֶת־קֵינָן

---

#### Transliteration:

_Vayeḥi Enosh tishʿim shanah,  
vayyoleid et-Qeynan._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And Enos lived one hundred and ninety years, and begot Cainan.”

> The LXX inflates the age by **+100 years** again, a consistent pattern throughout its version of Genesis 5. This shifts every generation **forward** in time and reduces patriarchal overlap.

---

#### DSS (4QGen-Exoda):

Confirms the MT figure of **ninety (90)** years — affirming fidelity to early Hebrew tradition.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“Enosh lived ninety years…”**

- Enosh’s age at Qeynan’s birth places the next AM anchor at **AM 325** (235 + 90).
    
- Enosh’s relatively young fatherhood reflects the **early maturity** of pre-Flood generations and confirms the MT’s tighter generational spread.
    

**“And begot Qeynan” (קֵינָן)**

- Name meaning uncertain, but often linked to _qana_ (to acquire) or _kinyan_ (possession).
    
- Not to be confused with **Qayin** — distinct spelling and lineage.
    

> Qeynan will be the fourth generation after Adam and contributes to the **righteous Shetite line**, later appearing in Luke’s genealogy of Messiah.

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- LXX’s alteration here undermines the **carefully preserved chronology** of the MT.
    

> The inflated dates disrupt the **patriarchal overlap** — key to understanding **oral transmission, righteousness continuity**, and the **covenantal thread** of early mankind.

- Some critics confuse Qeynan with the post-Flood **Kenanite peoples** or Canaan — but these are **linguistically and contextually unrelated**.
    

---

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Qeynan born at AM 325**

- Enosh is still in his prime. Adam is still alive (dies in AM 930), and most of the early patriarchs are overlapping.
    
- This marks the continuation of the **holy line**, which remains distinct from the corrupted Cainite culture.

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And Enos lived ninety years, and begat Cainan.”

**YLT:**  
“And Enos liveth ninety years, and begetteth Cainan.”

**NIV:**  
“When Enosh had lived 90 years, he became the father of Kenan.”

> All English translations follow MT — but NIV’s use of “Kenan” softens the distinctiveness of the **Hebrew Qeynan** (קֵינָן).

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

**Jubilees 4:13–15** — confirms Qeynan’s birth and continues the righteous line through this patriarch.

**Luke 3:37** — includes Qeynan in Yeshua’s genealogy.

**Genesis 6:9** — foreshadows that Noaḥ will descend from this line, tracing righteous continuity all the way from Shet through Qeynan.
