### **GENESIS 5:28**

_Scroll of the Generations of Adam_  
(Traditional Genesis 5:28)

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And Lamekh lived one hundred and eighty-two years, and begot a son.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וַיְחִי לָמֶךְ  
שְׁנַיִם וּשְׁמֹנִים שָׁנָה וּמְאַת שָׁנָה  
וַיּוֹלֶד בֵּן

---

#### Transliteration:

_Vayeḥi Lamekh  
shnayim u’shmonim shanah u’me’at shanah,  
vayyoleid ben._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And Lamech lived one hundred and eighty-eight years, and begot a son.”

> LXX adds **6 years** to Lamekh’s age at fatherhood — this change **breaks** the Genesis 5 math and affects the Flood chronology if carried forward.

---

#### DSS (4QGen-Exoda):

Confirms the MT — Lamekh fathers a son at **182 years**, with no alternate reading recorded.

---

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“One hundred and eighty-two years”**

- Aligns precisely with the broader Genesis 5 timeline.
    

> Lamekh was born in **AM 874**, so this son is born in **AM 1056** — the exact year recorded in Genesis 7:6 for Noaḥ’s age at the time of the Flood: **600 years old**.

- The **precision of these genealogical records** is astonishing — Noaḥ is born **600 years before the Flood** (AM 1656 – 600 = 1056), just as expected.
    

**“And begot a son”**

- The Hebrew _ben_ is indefinite here — the **name will follow** in v.29, drawing narrative attention to the **meaning** and **prophetic significance** of this child’s birth.
    

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- The LXX's +6-year alteration (188 vs. 182) **destroys the synchronized Flood chronology** established by the MT and reflected in 1 Enoch and Jubilees.
    

> If Noaḥ were born at AM 1062 instead of 1056, Methushelach (who dies at AM 1656) would be **six years dead before the Flood** — contradicting Genesis 7:11.

- The delayed naming (v.29) suggests that Lamekh saw **something unique or revelatory** in his son — which will be explored in the next verse.
    

---

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Noaḥ is born at AM 1056**

- Adam, Shet, Enosh, Qeynan, Mahalal’el, Yered, and Ḥanokh are gone.
    
- Methushelach is still alive and likely mentoring both Lamekh and Noaḥ.
    
- This birth occurs **exactly 600 years before the judgment of the Flood**.

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And Lamech lived an hundred eighty and two years, and begat a son:”

**YLT:**  
“And Lamech liveth an hundred and eighty and two years, and begetteth a son,”

**NIV:**  
“When Lamech had lived 182 years, he had a son.”

> All agree with MT. NIV is smoother but lacks the structured cadence.

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

**Genesis 5:29** — names the son as Noaḥ and gives Lamekh’s prophetic reasoning.

**Jubilees 4:28–30** — expands on Lamekh’s perception of Noaḥ as a destined redeemer figure.

**1 Enoch 106–107** — recounts a **prophetic dream** Lamekh had about his son’s future and the upheaval of the earth.
