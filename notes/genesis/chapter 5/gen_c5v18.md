### **GENESIS 5:18**

_Scroll of the Generations of Adam_  
(Traditional Genesis 5:18)

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And Yered lived one hundred and sixty-two years, and begot Ḥanokh.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וַיְחִי יָרֶד  
שְׁתַּיִם וְשִׁשִּׁים וּמְאַת שָׁנָה  
וַיּוֹלֶד אֶת־חֲנוֹךְ

---

#### Transliteration:

_Vayeḥi Yered  
shtayim ve’shishim u’me’at shanah,  
vayyoleid et-Ḥanokh._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And Jared lived one hundred and sixty-two years, and begot Enoch.”

> The LXX **matches the MT** here exactly, without inflation or abbreviation — unusual consistency at this stage.

---

#### DSS (4QGen-Exoda):

Fully confirms the MT — **162 years** at Ḥanokh’s birth, with no textual variation.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“Yered lived 162 years…”**

- This brings us to **AM 622** for Ḥanokh’s birth (460 + 162).
    
- This date becomes pivotal:  
    → It marks the entrance of a man **so righteous he will not die**.
    

**“And begot Ḥanokh” (חֲנוֹךְ)**

- Name meaning: **“dedicated,” “initiated,” or “consecrated.”**
    
- Hebrew root _chanakh_ (חנך) = to dedicate, inaugurate, or train (cf. Proverbs 22:6).
    

> His name foreshadows his **set-apartness** from birth — and likely his **discipline and instruction** of others.

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Some scholars dismiss Ḥanokh’s translation (v.24) as myth or metaphor — yet the Genesis text offers **no death formula**, breaking the pattern of every patriarch before him.
    

> This introductory verse sets up that break:  
> → He is the **only patriarch with a name meaning “dedicated”**, born in a generation of rising corruption.

- Later church traditions underemphasize Ḥanokh’s role, possibly to avoid legitimizing **1 Enoch**, which is **highly cited in early Christian literature**, including Jude.

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Ḥanokh born at AM 622**

- Adam is still alive (dies at AM 930), as are Shet and Enosh.
    
- Qeynan and Mahalal’el are in their final decades.
    
- Ḥanokh’s life will span **the most turbulent period** leading up to the Watchers’ rebellion and the judgment flood.

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And Jared lived an hundred sixty and two years, and he begat Enoch.”

**YLT:**  
“And Jared liveth an hundred and sixty and two years, and begetteth Enoch.”

**NIV:**  
“When Jared had lived 162 years, he became the father of Enoch.”

> The name “Enoch” is a Greek rendering. SWRD retains **Ḥanokh** for Hebraic integrity and to distinguish him from post-Flood descendants of similar name.

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

**Jubilees 4:20–22** — describes Ḥanokh’s wisdom, righteousness, and role in separating himself from the corrupt world.

**1 Enoch 1:1–9** — frames Ḥanokh as the **scribe and prophet** to both Watchers and men.

**Jude 1:14–15** — explicitly quotes Ḥanokh’s prophecy, confirming his prophetic authority.
