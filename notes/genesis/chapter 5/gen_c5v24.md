### **GENESIS 5:24**

_Scroll of the Generations of Adam_  
(Traditional Genesis 5:24)

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And Ḥanokh walked with Elohim, and he was not; for Elohim took him.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וַיִּתְהַלֵּךְ חֲנוֹךְ אֶת־הָאֱלֹהִים  
וְאֵינֶנּוּ  
כִּי לָקַח אֹתוֹ אֱלֹהִים

---

#### Transliteration:

_Vayyit’hallek Ḥanokh et ha’Elohim,  
ve’einennu,  
ki laqach oto Elohim._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And Enoch was well-pleasing to God, and was not found, because God translated him.”

> The LXX shifts **“walked with Elohim”** to “was well-pleasing,” which reflects **interpretive paraphrase** rather than direct equivalence. However, the idea of translation remains intact.

---

#### DSS (4QGen-Exoda):

Faithfully matches MT — preserves the **distinctive three-part structure** of the verse:

1. Walked with Elohim
    
2. Was no more
    
3. Elohim took him

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“Walked with Elohim” (וַיִּתְהַלֵּךְ)**

- This repetition (see v.22) **bookends** Ḥanokh’s life — uniquely setting him apart from all other patriarchs.
    

> Only **Noaḥ** shares this distinction (Genesis 6:9), but Ḥanokh is the **first and only pre-Flood man** whose walk with Elohim results in translation, not death.

**“And he was not” (וְאֵינֶנּוּ)**

- _Einennu_ = “he was not there” / “he was no longer” — implies **physical disappearance**, not just poetic language for death.
    

> Often used elsewhere to describe **vanishing or divine removal** (cf. Psalm 37:36; Jeremiah 31:15).

**“For Elohim took him” (כִּי לָקַח אֹתוֹ אֱלֹהִים)**

- _Lāqach_ (to take) can mean:
    
    - To seize
        
    - To receive into one’s presence
        
    - To take in marriage or protection
        

> In prophetic and poetic contexts, it often denotes **being drawn near by YHWH** — as in **Elijah’s whirlwind ascent** (2 Kings 2:11).

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- The **JEDP theory** treats this verse as mythic intrusion, but it is **ratified in the New Testament** (Hebrews 11:5, Jude 1:14–15).
    
- LXX’s substitution of “well-pleasing” dilutes the relational intimacy of the **walk** concept and introduces unnecessary abstraction.
    
- Many churches gloss over Ḥanokh’s translation to avoid dealing with **1 Enoch**, despite its clear alignment with this passage.

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Ḥanokh taken at AM 987**

- 669 years before the Flood
    
- 31 years before Methushelach fathers Lamekh (AM 1018)
    
- Adam, Shet, Enosh, Qeynan, and Mahalal’el have all died
    
- Yered will die 25 years later (AM 962), Methushelach remains
    

> His removal acts as both a **divine affirmation** and a **harbinger of judgment**.

---

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And Enoch walked with God: and he was not; for God took him.”

**YLT:**  
“And Enoch walketh habitually with God, and he is not, for God took him.”

**NIV:**  
“Enoch walked faithfully with God; then he was no more, because God took him away.”

> NIV modernizes phrasing but retains core meaning. YLT captures the **habitual walk**, and KJV preserves the mystery of the phrase _“he was not.”_

---

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

**Hebrews 11:5** — “By faith Ḥanokh was translated that he should not see death…”

**Jude 1:14–15** — quotes directly from Ḥanokh, affirming his prophetic role.

**1 Enoch 1:1–9; 12–16; 70–71** — details his **visions, warnings to the Watchers**, and ultimate **heavenly exaltation**.

**Jubilees 4:23–25** — declares Ḥanokh was “taken from among the sons of men” to be “among the angels” — and that **he wrote down heavenly knowledge**.
