### **GENESIS 5:5**

_Scroll of the Generations of Adam_  
(Traditional Genesis 5:5)

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years, and he died.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וַיְהִי כָּל יְמֵי־אָדָם  
אֲשֶׁר חַי  
תְּשַׁע מֵאוֹת שָׁנָה וּשְׁלֹשִׁים שָׁנָה  
וַיָּמֹת

---

#### Transliteration:

_Vayehi kol yemei-Adam  
asher chai  
teshaʿ me’ot shanah u’sheloshim shanah,  
vayyamot._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And all the days of Adam which he lived were nine hundred and thirty years, and he died.”

> The LXX corrects itself here and matches MT, despite earlier saying Adam lived 700 years after Shet (v.4). The total is **still 930 years**, preserving harmony at this point.

---

#### DSS (4QGen-Exoda):

Affirms the MT: **930 years**, followed by death. This cements the death as literal and final, not metaphorical or spiritual only.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“All the days that Adam lived…”**

- Formal phrase used repeatedly in this chapter to summarize lifespans.
    
- Reflects a **structured genealogical register** — suitable for covenantal or scribal records.
    

**“Nine hundred and thirty years”**

- The **longest recorded human lifespan until Methushelach** (969).
    
- Includes **130 years before Shet**, and **800 years after** — a life that spans nearly the first millennium of human history.
    

**“And he died” (וַיָּמֹת)**

- Marks the **first explicit recorded death** after Havel.
    
- Confirms the **penalty of Genesis 2:17**: _“In the day you eat of it, you shall surely die.”_  
    → Though delayed, death is **inescapable** — a result of sin.
    

> This phrase is repeated **eight more times** in this chapter — echoing the theme: “and he died… and he died…”

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Some liberal or allegorical traditions attempt to spiritualize Adam’s death, arguing that he “died spiritually” in Eden and this is just incidental.  
    → But this text explicitly affirms **physical mortality** as well — both apply.
    
- LXX’s inconsistency in verse 4 casts doubt on its reliability for timeline reconstruction here.  
    → SWRD adheres to MT’s **internal mathematical coherence** unless contradicted by strong multi-source evidence.

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Adam dies at AM 930**

- His death closes the **first epoch** of human history — spanning from the sixth day of creation to within a century of Noaḥ’s birth (AM 1056).
    
- Adam lived to see **nine generations** of descendants — including **Lamekh**, Noaḥ’s father (Gen 5:28–29).

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years: and he died.”

**YLT:**  
“And all the days of Adam which he lived are nine hundred and thirty years, and he dieth.”

**NIV:**  
“Altogether, Adam lived a total of 930 years, and then he died.”

> All versions align well here, though only KJV/YLT preserve the **judicial rhythm** of “and he died.”

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

**Genesis 2:17** — The promised consequence of sin fulfilled.

**Romans 5:12** — “Through one man sin entered the world, and death through sin…”

**1 Corinthians 15:22** — “As in Adam all die…”

**Jubilees 4:29–30** — Notes Adam’s burial in the Cave of Treasures and commemorates his death with solemnity.
