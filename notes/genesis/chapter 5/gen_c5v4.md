### **GENESIS 5:4**

_Scroll of the Generations of Adam_  
(Traditional Genesis 5:4)

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And the days of Adam after he begot Shet were eight hundred years, and he begot sons and daughters.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וַיִּהְיוּ יְמֵי־אָדָם  
אַחֲרֵי הוֹלִידוֹ אֶת־שֵׁת  
שְׁמֹנֶה מֵאוֹת שָׁנָה  
וַיּוֹלֶד בָּנִים וּבָנוֹת

---

#### Transliteration:

_Vayihyu yemei-Adam  
acharei holido et-Shet  
shemoneh me’ot shanah,  
vayyoleid banim u’vanot._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And the days of Adam after he begot Seth were seven hundred years; and he begot sons and daughters.”

> The LXX differs here again — giving **700** years instead of **800**, which will affect the total lifespan in the next verse.

---

#### DSS (4QGen-Exoda):

Matches the MT — confirms **800 years**, and retains plural **sons and daughters**. No evidence of the LXX numerical shift.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“Eight hundred years after Shet”**

- Adam continues to live from **AM 130 to AM 930**.
    
- The post-Shet period is the **longest continuous generational window** in human history — nearly 8 centuries of direct oversight from the first man.
    

**“And he begot sons and daughters”**

- Confirms a **large population base** from Adam and Havvah.
    
- These sons/daughters are unnamed — but this verse justifies Cain and Seth both having wives and offspring **well before the Flood**.
    

> Early humanity expanded **exponentially** in these centuries — with each patriarch producing **large tribal clans**.

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Modern critics often ask, “Where did Cain get his wife?” — but this verse directly answers it: Adam and Havvah bore **many other children**.
    

> This is the **explicit scriptural basis** for early intra-family marriage — a necessity in the post-Edenic world and not yet forbidden by Mosaic Law.

- LXX’s reduced lifespan creates timeline confusion — again altering genealogical integrity used by Jubilees and Luke.
    

---

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**AM 130–930**

- Adam lives **800 more years** after Shet’s birth.
    
- His lifespan will be confirmed and closed in the next verse.

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And the days of Adam after he had begotten Seth were eight hundred years: and he begat sons and daughters.”

**YLT:**  
“And the days of Adam after his begetting Seth are eight hundred years, and he begetteth sons and daughters.”

**NIV:**  
“After Seth was born, Adam lived 800 years and had other sons and daughters.”

> All major translations follow MT here. NIV’s “other sons and daughters” is interpretive, but helpful.

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

**Genesis 4:17–22** — Cain’s descendants establish trades and cities; many of Adam’s unnamed sons/daughters may be involved.

**Genesis 6:1–2** — Refers to “the daughters of men,” which some traditions interpret as these unnamed offspring.

**Jubilees 4:1–9** — Names more of Adam’s children and their marriages; provides relational links between Cain’s and Seth’s descendants.
