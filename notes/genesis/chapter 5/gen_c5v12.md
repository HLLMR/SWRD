### **GENESIS 5:12**

_Scroll of the Generations of Adam_  
(Traditional Genesis 5:12)

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And Qeynan lived seventy years, and begot Mahalal’el.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וַיְחִי קֵינָן  
שִׁבְעִים שָׁנָה  
וַיּוֹלֶד אֶת־מַהֲלַלְאֵל

---

#### Transliteration:

_Vayeḥi Qeynan  
shivʿim shanah,  
vayyoleid et-Mahalal’el._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And Cainan lived one hundred and seventy years, and begot Maleleel.”

> As with previous patriarchs, the **LXX inflates the age at fatherhood by 100 years**, shifting timelines and reducing overlap among generations.

---

#### DSS (4QGen-Exoda):

Confirms the MT — Qeynan’s age at Mahalal’el’s birth is recorded as **70 years**, not 170.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“Qeynan lived seventy years…”**

- Compared to his predecessors, Qeynan is the **youngest father so far** in Genesis 5.
    
- Mahalal’el is born at **AM 395** (325 + 70), continuing the covenant line from Adam to Noaḥ without generational gaps.
    

**“And begot Mahalal’el” (מַהֲלַלְאֵל)**

- Name meaning: **“Praise of El”** or **“El is praised.”**
    
- A profoundly theocentric name — possibly reflecting a **revivalist generation** or renewed dedication to YHWH.
    

> Qeynan naming his son “Praise of God” may signal either:

- An act of gratitude for faithfulness,
    
- Or a reaction against cultural corruption rising outside the righteous line.
    

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- The LXX inflation here is particularly disruptive, as it compounds further in the lifespans of Mahalal’el, Yered, and Ḥanokh — leading to **chronological breaks** that contradict the MT and DSS.
    
- Qeynan’s identity is often blurred in traditions unfamiliar with **Luke 3:37**, which confirms his role in Messiah’s ancestry.
    

> Some critical scholarship has even doubted Qeynan’s historical existence — yet he appears in the MT, DSS, LXX, and NT alike.

---

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Mahalal’el born at AM 395**

- At this point, **Adam, Shet, and Enosh are all still alive**, and so is Qeynan’s father, Enosh — all of whom may have participated in teaching and mentoring Mahalal’el.
    
- This represents the **fifth generation** of humanity.

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And Cainan lived seventy years, and begat Mahalaleel.”

**YLT:**  
“And Cainan liveth seventy years, and begetteth Mahalaleel.”

**NIV:**  
“When Kenan had lived 70 years, he became the father of Mahalalel.”

> NIV’s “Kenan” continues its Anglicized naming scheme — accurate phonetically, but loses **the distinctive Hebrew identity** of Qeynan.

---

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

**Jubilees 4:15–18** — gives a moral characterization of Qeynan and expands slightly on Mahalal’el’s naming.

**Luke 3:37** — confirms Qeynan and Mahalal’el as ancestors of Yeshua.

**Psalm 113:3** — “From the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same, the name of YHWH is to be praised” — a thematic echo of _Mahalal’el_'s name meaning.
