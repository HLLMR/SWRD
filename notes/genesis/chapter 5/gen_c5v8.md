### **GENESIS 5:8**

_Scroll of the Generations of Adam_  
(Traditional Genesis 5:8)

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And all the days of Shet were nine hundred and twelve years, and he died.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וַיִּהְיוּ כָל יְמֵי שֵׁת  
תְּשַׁע מֵאוֹת שָׁנָה וּשְׁתֵּים עֶשְׂרֵה שָׁנָה  
וַיָּמֹת

---

#### Transliteration:

_Vayihyu kol yemei Shet  
teshaʿ me’ot shanah u’shteim esreh shanah,  
vayyamot._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And all the days of Seth were nine hundred and twelve years, and he died.”

> LXX aligns with MT here, despite having previously altered Shet’s age at Enosh’s birth and his subsequent lifespan.

---

#### DSS (4QGen-Exoda):

Fully confirms the MT — Shet’s total lifespan is recorded as **912 years**.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“All the days of Shet…”**

- Reinforces the structured **death cadence** of Genesis 5:  
    → He lived… he begot… he begot more… and he died.
    

> Despite righteousness, mortality reigns. Shet’s death marks the first full **post-Edenic covenantal patriarchal cycle**.

**“Nine hundred and twelve years”**

- Precise and consistent with internal MT math:  
    105 (Enosh) + 807 (post-Enosh) = 912
    
- Shet’s death occurs in **AM 1042**.
    

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Some traditions treat Genesis 5’s genealogies as **mythic or symbolic** — yet the text gives **specific numerical detail**, precisely structured.
    

> These are not vague time frames; they are **lineage records**, consistent with the _toledot_ scroll structure outlined in Genesis 5:1.

- Early rabbinic literature and Jubilees treat these numbers as **literal and legal** — foundational to reckoning priestly succession, Sabbath cycles, and eventual Jubilee laws.
    

---

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Shet dies at AM 1042**

- Just 14 years before Noaḥ’s birth (AM 1056).
    
- This means Shet lived through the entire lives of **Enosh, Qeynan, Mahalal’el**, and nearly all of **Yered**.
    

> The **generational overlap** enabled the direct transmission of truth across centuries.

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And all the days of Seth were nine hundred and twelve years: and he died.”

**YLT:**  
“And all the days of Seth are nine hundred and twelve years, and he dieth.”

**NIV:**  
“Seth lived a total of 912 years, and then he died.”

> All preserve the data, though the NIV’s phrasing is less formal or liturgical.

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

**Romans 5:14** — “Death reigned from Adam to Moses…” — even over the righteous like Shet.

**Jubilees 4:14–15** — commemorates Shet’s wisdom and death; emphasizes his commitment to the laws and instruction of Elohim.

**1 Corinthians 15:22** — “In Adam all die…” — a refrain woven through Genesis 5.
