### **GENESIS 5:6**

_Scroll of the Generations of Adam_  
(Traditional Genesis 5:6)

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And Shet lived one hundred and five years, and begot Enosh.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וַיְחִי שֵׁת חָמֵשׁ שָׁנִים וּמְאַת שָׁנָה  
וַיּוֹלֶד אֶת־אֱנוֹשׁ

---

#### Transliteration:

_Vayeḥi Shet chamesh shanim u’me’at shanah,  
vayyoleid et-Enosh._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And Seth lived two hundred and five years, and begot Enos.”

> LXX again inflates the age by **100 years**, setting a divergent chronological precedent throughout this chapter.

---

#### DSS (4QGen-Exoda):

Affirms the MT — **105 years** at the birth of Enosh, matching the internal chronology precisely.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“Shet lived 105 years…”**

- Shet is the **first fully post-Edenic generation** and the founder of the righteous lineage.
    
- His age at Enosh’s birth anchors the **next major AM timestamp**.
    

> This places Enosh’s birth at **AM 235** (130 + 105), confirming our previous placement from Genesis 4:26.

**“Begot Enosh”**

- Enosh (אֱנוֹשׁ) = “man,” especially frail or mortal man — a thematic shift from _Adam_ (formed man) to _Enosh_ (fragile man).
    
- His generation is marked by the **return to calling on the Name of YHWH** (Genesis 4:26).
    

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Again, LXX’s date shift begins to compound genealogical drift — leading to **inconsistencies in timeline-based doctrines**, including Flood dating and messianic prophecy counts.
    

> This divergence is critical for reconstructions like **Jubilees** or **Luke 3**, which lean on MT-style math.

- Enosh’s name often goes unexplored — yet it reflects the **spiritual climate of his time**: mortal awareness, dependence on YHWH, or even weakness in the face of rising corruption (cf. Genesis 6).
    

---

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Enosh born at AM 235**

- This begins the **third generation**: Adam → Shet → Enosh.
    
- Public worship or covenantal invocation of YHWH also likely began at or near this date (cf. 4:26).

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And Seth lived an hundred and five years, and begat Enos.”

**YLT:**  
“And Seth liveth an hundred and five years, and begetteth Enos.”

**NIV:**  
“When Seth had lived 105 years, he became the father of Enosh.”

> All follow the MT in age — though only KJV/YLT preserve the biblical phrasing structure.

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

**Genesis 4:26** — “Then it was begun to call on the Name of YHWH.”

**Jubilees 4:11–13** — adds details about Enosh’s righteousness and marriage alliances among Shet’s descendants.

**Psalm 8:4** — “What is Enosh, that You are mindful of him?” — uses _Enosh_ as emblem of human frailty.
