### **GENESIS 5:26**

_Scroll of the Generations of Adam_  
(Traditional Genesis 5:26)

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And Methushelach lived after he begot Lamekh seven hundred and eighty-two years, and he begot sons and daughters.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וַיְחִי מְתוּשֶׁלַח  
אַחֲרֵי הוֹלִידוֹ אֶת־לָמֶךְ  
שְׁמֹנֶה וּשְׁמֹנִים שָׁנָה וּשְׁבַע מֵאוֹת שָׁנָה  
וַיּוֹלֶד בָּנִים וּבָנוֹת

---

#### Transliteration:

_Vayeḥi Methushelach  
acharei holido et-Lamekh  
shemoneh u’shmonim shanah u’sheva me’ot shanah,  
vayyoleid banim u’vanot._

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And Mathusala lived after he begot Lamech seven hundred and two years, and begot sons and daughters.”

> LXX subtracts **80 years** from the post-Lamekh lifespan — in line with its earlier **20-year reduction** of Methushelach’s age at Lamekh’s birth.

> This ultimately brings the total to **969** (as in MT), but **disrupts** the internal consistency required for Flood chronology.

---

#### DSS (4QGen-Exoda):

Confirms the MT — Methushelach lived **782 years after** Lamekh’s birth, continuing to father unnamed children.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“Seven hundred and eighty-two years”**

- With this, Methushelach’s total lifespan reaches **969 years**, the longest of all patriarchs (confirmed in v.27).
    

> He outlives his son Lamekh (d. AM 1651) and dies **in the very year the Flood begins (AM 1656)** — possibly **in the same month or week**, just prior to the deluge.

**“And begot sons and daughters”**

- Methushelach’s offspring would have been numerous, potentially numbering in the hundreds.
    

> While only Noaḥ’s line is preserved, **his other descendants may have intermarried with corrupted lines**, foreshadowing Genesis 6:1–2.

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- The LXX’s number shifts result in Methushelach dying **14 years before the Flood** — conflicting with Genesis 7:11.
    

> This undermines the Flood’s **symbolic closure of the righteous line**, since Methushelach’s name has been interpreted (by tradition) as:  
> **“His death shall bring [judgment].”**

- Many modern teachers ignore Methushelach’s **prophetic timing**, treating the genealogy as trivia rather than **chronological revelation**.

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Methushelach’s post-Lamekh years: AM 874–1656**  
**Total lifespan: 969 years** (confirmed next verse)

> Methushelach is the **final link** between Ḥanokh and Noaḥ — a living archive of divine truth in the most corrupt age.

---

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And Methuselah lived after he begat Lamech seven hundred eighty and two years, and begat sons and daughters.”

**YLT:**  
“And Methuselah liveth after his begetting Lamech seven hundred and eighty and two years, and begetteth sons and daughters.”

**NIV:**  
“After he became the father of Lamech, Methuselah lived 782 years and had other sons and daughters.”

> All translations follow MT. NIV continues to soften the **genealogical cadence** by paraphrasing.

---

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

**Jubilees 4:27–28** — describes Methushelach teaching righteousness, writing down his father’s wisdom, and warning of the coming judgment.

**1 Enoch 69–71** — portrays Methushelach as the recipient of Ḥanokh’s last visions — including those about **the Son of Man** and the judgment of angels and kings.

**Genesis 6:1–2** — his many unnamed sons and daughters were likely swept into the corruption that necessitated the Flood.
