### **GENESIS 5:23**

_Scroll of the Generations of Adam_  
(Traditional Genesis 5:23)

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And all the days of Ḥanokh were three hundred and sixty-five years.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וַיְהִי כָּל יְמֵי חֲנוֹךְ  
שְׁלֹשׁ מֵאוֹת שָׁנָה וְחָמֵשׁ שָׁנִים

---

#### Transliteration:

_Vayehi kol yemei Ḥanokh  
shelosh me’ot shanah ve’chamesh shanim._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And all the days of Enoch were three hundred and sixty-five years.”

> LXX is **in full agreement** here — despite reducing Ḥanokh’s walk to 200 years in v.22, the total lifespan is still preserved at **365**.

---

#### DSS (4QGen-Exoda):

Confirms the MT — Ḥanokh lived a total of **365 years**, consistent with the symbolic fullness of a solar year.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“Three hundred and sixty-five years”**

- This **breaks the pattern** of lifespans near 900 years — dramatically shorter than his forebears.
    

> The number **365** carries strong symbolic weight:

- Corresponds to the number of **solar days in a year**
    
- Implies **completeness, order, celestial alignment**
    
- This makes Ḥanokh the **first “taken” man**, bypassing death and establishing the first precedent of **translation into Elohim’s presence**.
    

> His life stands in **sharp contrast** to the death chorus of Genesis 5: _“and he died”_ — which is **absent** from his record.

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Many commentators downplay the significance of 365, ignoring its possible **cosmic or calendar symbolism** in Hebrew thought.
    
- Attempts to read this verse metaphorically (“he lived well”) **defy the plain reading** of the Hebrew and the testimony of Jude, Hebrews, and 1 Enoch.

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Ḥanokh translated at AM 987**

- This occurs:
    
    - 57 years after Adam’s death (AM 930)
        
    - 31 years before Methushelach fathers Lamekh (AM 1018)
        
    - 669 years before the Flood (AM 1656)
        

> His removal is both a **judgment on the world** and a **reward for his walk** — an early sign that **righteousness escapes wrath**.

---

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And all the days of Enoch were three hundred sixty and five years.”

**YLT:**  
“And all the days of Enoch are three hundred and sixty and five years.”

**NIV:**  
“Enoch lived a total of 365 years.”

> All versions agree numerically, but **only MT and literal translations** emphasize the structure of “all the days of…” — matching the legal phrasing of the other patriarchs.

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

**Hebrews 11:5** — “By faith Ḥanokh was translated that he should not see death…”

**Jubilees 4:24** — says he was taken from the midst of the children of men, to be with the angels of Elohim.

**1 Enoch 70–71** — elaborates on Ḥanokh’s translation, exaltation, and vision of the Son of Man.
