### **GENESIS 5:32**

_Scroll of the Generations of Adam_  
(Traditional Genesis 5:32)

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And Noaḥ was five hundred years old; and Noaḥ begot Shem, Ḥam, and Yapheth.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וַיְהִי נֹחַ בֶּן־חֲמֵשׁ מֵאוֹת שָׁנָה  
וַיּוֹלֶד נֹחַ אֶת־שֵׁם אֶת־חָם וְאֶת־יָפֶת

---

#### Transliteration:

_Vayehi Noaḥ ben-chamesh me’ot shanah,  
vayyoleid Noaḥ et-Shem, et-Ḥam, ve’et-Yapheth._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And Noe was five hundred years old, and he begot three sons: Shem, Cham, and Japheth.”

> LXX matches MT, although it often **reorders** the sons differently than MT in other contexts — leading to some confusion about birth order.

---

#### DSS (4QGen-Exoda):

Matches MT — Noaḥ is **500 years old** at the time his sons begin to be born. The names appear in **Shem–Ḥam–Yapheth** order, though this is **not chronological**.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“Five hundred years old”**

- This summary verse **closes the genealogy** and transitions to the next scroll (Genesis 6).
    
- Noaḥ is born in **AM 1056**, so this verse brings us to **AM 1556** — just **100 years before the Flood** (AM 1656).
    

> His sons will be born over the following decades — not all at once.

**“Shem, Ḥam, and Yapheth”**

- The order **does not imply birth sequence**:
    
    - **Yapheth** is the oldest (cf. Genesis 10:21)
        
    - **Shem** is likely second
        
    - **Ḥam** is youngest (cf. Genesis 9:24)
        

> Shem is listed first here for **covenantal and spiritual prominence**, not chronological priority — he is the ancestor of **Eber, Avraham, and ultimately Messiah**.

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Many Bibles and commentaries assume this verse suggests **triplets** or a single birth year — but the Hebrew does **not require simultaneity**.
    

> It’s a **summary statement**. The actual birth sequence unfolds across **Genesis 6–11**.

- Overemphasis on Shem’s placement has led to doctrinal confusion regarding **lineage, inheritance, and identity** — especially in post-biblical racial theory and theological constructs.
    

---

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Noaḥ turns 500 in AM 1556**

- His sons are born **between AM 1556–1559**, with Noaḥ at **600 years old** when the Flood comes (Genesis 7:6).
    
- This verse spans a **narrative bridge**:  
    → From the righteous seed of Adam  
    → To the remnant through which Elohim will **preserve mankind**

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And Noah was five hundred years old: and Noah begat Shem, Ham, and Japheth.”

**YLT:**  
“And Noah is a son of five hundred years, and Noah begetteth Shem, Ham, and Japheth.”

**NIV:**  
“After Noah was 500 years old, he became the father of Shem, Ham and Japheth.”

> All agree with MT. NIV smooths the flow but misses the solemn closing tone of the Genesis 5 genealogy.

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

**Genesis 6:1–10** — follows immediately with the rise of Nephilim and YHWH’s judgment.

**Genesis 10:21** — clarifies birth order, noting Yapheth as the elder.

**Jubilees 5:1–5** — presents these sons as central to the preservation of righteousness and division of the post-Flood world.

**1 Enoch 106–107** — includes traditions about Noaḥ’s birth and destiny that tie directly into the judgment motif now looming.
