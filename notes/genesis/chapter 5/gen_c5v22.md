### **GENESIS 5:22**

_Scroll of the Generations of Adam_  
(Traditional Genesis 5:22)

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And Ḥanokh walked with Elohim after he begot Methushelach three hundred years, and he begot sons and daughters.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וַיִּתְהַלֵּךְ חֲנוֹךְ אֶת־הָאֱלֹהִים  
אַחֲרֵי הוֹלִידוֹ אֶת־מְתוּשֶׁלַח  
שְׁלֹשׁ מֵאוֹת שָׁנָה  
וַיּוֹלֶד בָּנִים וּבָנוֹת

---

#### Transliteration:

_Vayyit’hallek Ḥanokh et ha-Elohim  
acharei holido et-Methushelach  
shelosh me’ot shanah,  
vayyoleid banim u’vanot._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And Enoch was well-pleasing to God after he begot Methuselah two hundred years, and begot sons and daughters.”

> The **LXX shortens the post-Methushelach years to 200**, which contradicts the MT, DSS, and New Testament affirmations of Ḥanokh’s 365-year life.

---

#### DSS (4QGen-Exoda):

Fully matches MT — Ḥanokh **walked with Elohim** for **300 years after** Methushelach’s birth and begot other children.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“Walked with Elohim” (וַיִּתְהַלֵּךְ אֶת־הָאֱלֹהִים)**

- _Hit’hallek_ (reflexive form) implies **continual, intimate, disciplined movement** with Elohim — not just moral living, but **relational obedience**.
    

> Only Ḥanokh and Noaḥ are said to have "walked with Elohim" — both are associated with **grace, righteousness, and preservation** amid wickedness.

- This phrase **does not occur** with any other patriarch in Genesis 5, setting Ḥanokh apart as **prophet, intercessor, and reformer**.
    

**“Three hundred years”**

- These years span **AM 687 to AM 987**, ending with his mysterious removal (v.24).
    
- During this time, Ḥanokh:
    
    - Preaches against wickedness (Jude 14),
        
    - Receives visions (1 Enoch),
        
    - Likely mentors Methushelach and Lamekh.
        

**“And begot sons and daughters”**

- A quiet but weighty phrase — even while living in communion with Elohim, Ḥanokh **engaged in family life**.
    

> His descendants, though unnamed, were likely part of the remnant community **resisting the corruption** of the age.

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- The **LXX truncates Ḥanokh’s walk** by 100 years, softening the power of his legacy.
    

> This misalignment undermines his **symbolic perfection** (365 = days in a solar year) and disrupts the theological symmetry carried by Genesis and the Book of Enoch.

- Many institutional Bibles gloss over “walked with Elohim” as simply “he lived” — but this **misses the relational weight and prophetic posture** of the term.
    

---

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Ḥanokh walks with Elohim: AM 687–987**

- This is the **third most important span** in early Genesis:
    
    1. Creation (AM 0)
        
    2. The Flood (AM 1656)
        
    3. Ḥanokh’s walk (AM 687–987)
        

> His removal just before the rise of Nephilim corruption marks a **heavenly endorsement of his generation** — and a prophetic warning.

---

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And Enoch walked with God after he begat Methuselah three hundred years, and begat sons and daughters.”

**YLT:**  
“And Enoch walketh habitually with God after his begetting Methuselah three hundred years, and begetteth sons and daughters.”

**NIV:**  
“After he became the father of Methuselah, Enoch walked faithfully with God 300 years and had other sons and daughters.”

> All capture the basic idea, but **only YLT and MT retain the nuance** of **habitual, lifelong communion** with the Almighty.

---

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

**Jude 1:14–15** — directly cites Ḥanokh’s prophecy.

**1 Enoch 12–16** — recounts his confrontation with the Watchers, and his heavenly journey.

**Jubilees 4:23–24** — praises Ḥanokh’s wisdom, notes that he wrote heavenly books, and mentions that he was taken to Paradise.
