### **GENESIS 5:1**

(Traditional Genesis 5:1)

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**This is the scroll of the generations of Adam. In the day that Elohim created man, in the likeness of Elohim He made him.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

זֶה סֵפֶר תּוֹלְדֹת אָדָם  
בְּיוֹם בְּרֹא אֱלֹהִים אָדָם  
בִּדְמוּת אֱלֹהִים עָשָׂה אֹתוֹ

---

#### Transliteration:

_Zeh sefer toledot Adam;  
b’yom b’ro Elohim Adam,  
bid’mut Elohim asah oto._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“This is the book of the generation of men: in the day that God made Adam, in the image of God He made him.”

> LXX replaces “Adam” with “men” (ἀνθρώπων), introducing a **universalizing shift** not supported by the MT.

---

#### DSS (4QGen-Exoda):

Fully matches MT. Phrase “sefer toledot Adam” confirms **scroll/book of generations of Adam**, not a generic “mankind.”

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“This is the scroll of the generations of Adam” (זֶה סֵפֶר תּוֹלְדֹת אָדָם)**

- _Sefer_ = **scroll or book**, indicating an organized record — not merely a casual list.
    
- _Toledot_ = generations, genealogical record, or **narrative legacy**.
    
- First use of _sefer_ in Scripture — may imply an actual **written record** passed down.
    

> This marks a **new scroll division** — a formal narrative shift from the line of Qayin to that of Shet.

**“In the day Elohim created man”**

- _B’yom_ = “in the day” — idiomatic, not strictly 24 hours. Recaps **Day 6**.
    

**“In the likeness of Elohim He made him” (בִּדְמוּת אֱלֹהִים עָשָׂה אֹתוֹ)**

- _Demut_ = resemblance, form, pattern — emphasizes **divine imprint**.
    
- Parallel to **Genesis 1:26–27**, reinforcing Adam’s creation in the image/likeness of Elohim — not corrupted, despite the Fall.
    

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- LXX’s shift to “men” instead of “Adam” subtly disconnects this from the **personal covenantal line**.
    
- Modern translations often fail to emphasize _sefer_ — minimizing the idea of **written patriarchal recordkeeping**.
    

> This undermines the idea that the early patriarchs could and did keep **genealogical scrolls** — a foundational assumption of the SWRD project.

---

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Not a date-stamped verse**, but a **summary header** referring to creation events starting at **AM 0**. It introduces a retrospective record spanning **AM 0 through 1056** (up to Noaḥ).

---

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“This is the book of the generations of Adam. In the day that God created man, in the likeness of God made He him.”

**YLT:**  
“This is an account of the generations of Adam. In the day of God’s creating man, in the likeness of God He hath made him.”

**NIV:**  
“This is the written account of Adam’s family line. When God created mankind, He made them in the likeness of God.”

> NIV generalizes “Adam” into “mankind” — again undermining the **individual genealogical scroll** structure.

---

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

**Genesis 1:26–27** — reinforces divine image and likeness.

**Genesis 2:7** — elaborates Adam’s creation from dust, personalized breath of life.

**Jubilees 3:1–3** — begins detailed chronology of Adam’s life, expanding on his deeds post-Eden.

**Luke 3:38** — New Testament genealogy explicitly identifies Adam as “son of Elohim,” reinforcing this divine likeness.
