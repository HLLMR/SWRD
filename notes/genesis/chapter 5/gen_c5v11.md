### **GENESIS 5:11**

_Scroll of the Generations of Adam_  
(Traditional Genesis 5:11)

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And all the days of Enosh were nine hundred and five years, and he died.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וַיְהִי כָּל יְמֵי אֱנוֹשׁ  
תְּשַׁע מֵאוֹת שָׁנָה וְחָמֵשׁ שָׁנִים  
וַיָּמֹת

---

#### Transliteration:

_Vayehi kol yemei Enosh  
teshaʿ me’ot shanah ve’chamesh shanim,  
vayyamot._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And all the days of Enos were nine hundred and five years, and he died.”

> LXX aligns here with the MT — despite altering previous verse data. The total is **905 years** in both sources, preserving consistency at the endpoint.

---

#### DSS (4QGen-Exoda):

Confirms MT’s final tally of **905 years** for Enosh. The phrase “and he died” (_vayyamot_) is present, matching the death cadence of Genesis 5.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“All the days of Enosh…”**

- Echoes the **death formula** that closes each patriarch’s life.
    
- Continues the narrative rhythm: **He lived… he begot… he begot more… and he died.**
    

**“Nine hundred and five years”**

- MT math remains consistent:  
    → 90 (Qeynan’s birth) + 815 (post-Qeynan) = 905
    

> Enosh lives long enough to see the births of Qeynan, Mahalal’el, and Yered — but **dies 84 years before Ḥanokh is born** (AM 1224).

**“And he died” (וַיָּמֹת)**

- Another drumbeat in the **line of death** first sounded with Adam (v.5).
    
- Despite calling on YHWH’s Name (Gen 4:26), Enosh **cannot escape the curse** — the promise of Genesis 2:17 still stands.
    

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- The constancy of death in this chapter has been **overlooked in favor of focusing on longevity**, but the **finality of each life** is the true emphasis.
    

> Even the righteous — even those who invoked YHWH’s Name — **still die**.  
> This sets up the **dramatic contrast** with Ḥanokh in verse 24: _“and he was not, for Elohim took him.”_

- Allegorical interpreters often reduce this to a poetic cycle, but the text is carefully structured to **ground real historical continuity**.

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Enosh dies at AM 1140**

- This is **210 years before the Flood** (AM 1656).
    
- He dies before the rise of the Watchers’ corruption detailed in Enoch and hinted at in Genesis 6.

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And all the days of Enos were nine hundred and five years: and he died.”

**YLT:**  
“And all the days of Enos are nine hundred and five years, and he dieth.”

**NIV:**  
“Altogether, Enosh lived a total of 905 years, and then he died.”

> All are faithful to MT; NIV’s “then he died” feels less weighty than the **rhythmic finality** of the Hebrew.

---

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

**Jubilees 4:17–18** — briefly records Enosh’s death and emphasizes his piety.

**Romans 5:14** — confirms death reigned “from Adam to Moses,” even over the righteous.

**Genesis 5:24** — Ḥanokh’s coming “exception” will highlight Enosh’s death as part of the necessary contrast.
