### **GENESIS 5:30**

_Scroll of the Generations of Adam_  
(Traditional Genesis 5:30)

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And Lamekh lived after he begot Noaḥ five hundred and ninety-five years, and he begot sons and daughters.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וַיְחִי לָמֶךְ  
אַחֲרֵי הוֹלִידוֹ אֶת־נֹחַ  
חָמֵשׁ מֵאוֹת שָׁנָה וְתִשְׁעִים וְחָמֵשׁ שָׁנִים  
וַיּוֹלֶד בָּנִים וּבָנוֹת

---

#### Transliteration:

_Vayeḥi Lamekh  
acharei holido et-Noaḥ  
chamesh me’ot shanah ve’tishʿim ve’chamesh shanim,  
vayyoleid banim u’vanot._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And Lamech lived after he begot Noe five hundred and sixty-five years, and begot sons and daughters.”

> The LXX subtracts **30 years** from Lamekh’s post-Noaḥ lifespan, breaking alignment with the **AM death date** found in the MT.

---

#### DSS (4QGen-Exoda):

Affirms the **MT** — Lamekh lived **595 years after Noaḥ’s birth**, continuing the pattern of extended patriarchal life.

---

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“Five hundred and ninety-five years”**

- Added to the 182 years before Noaḥ, Lamekh’s **total lifespan will be 777 years** (v.31).
    

> These years span **AM 1056–1651**, placing Lamekh’s death **just 5 years before the Flood**.

**“And he begot sons and daughters”**

- Like his predecessors, Lamekh fathered many unnamed children.
    

> These children — especially the _daughters of men_ (cf. Genesis 6:1–2) — likely represent the **final generation before the Nephilim corruption peaks**.

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Many miss the **prophetic foreshadowing** in Lamekh’s life:
    
    - His name means **“powerful” or “to strike”**
        
    - His years end in **777**, a number of **completion and divine order**
        
- The LXX’s altered figure (565 vs. 595) disrupts the AM dating of **both his death (1651)** and the **birth-to-Flood interval (600 years)** for Noaḥ.

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Lamekh’s post-Noaḥ years: AM 1056–1651**

- Dies **just 5 years before the Flood** (AM 1656).
    
- He lives to see:
    
    - Methushelach’s final years
        
    - Noaḥ’s full adult life
        
    - Likely the birth of Noaḥ’s sons (cf. Genesis 5:32)
        

> He is the **last patriarch to die before judgment falls**, apart from Methushelach.

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And Lamech lived after he begat Noah five hundred ninety and five years, and begat sons and daughters.”

**YLT:**  
“And Lamech liveth after his begetting Noah five hundred and ninety and five years, and begetteth sons and daughters.”

**NIV:**  
“After Noah was born, Lamech lived 595 years and had other sons and daughters.”

> All follow MT. NIV again paraphrases, while KJV/YLT maintain the structured cadence.

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

**Genesis 6:1–2** — Lamekh’s “sons and daughters” may directly precede the **Watcher-human unions** that provoke the Flood.

**Jubilees 4:30–5:2** — connects Lamekh’s final years to **rising violence**, **lawlessness**, and **angelic corruption**.

**1 Enoch 106–107** — describes Lamekh's unease at Noaḥ’s birth, foreshadowing the coming upheaval.
