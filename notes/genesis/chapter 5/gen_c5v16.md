### **GENESIS 5:16**

_Scroll of the Generations of Adam_  
(Traditional Genesis 5:16)

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And Mahalal’el lived after he begot Yered eight hundred and thirty years, and he begot sons and daughters.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וַיְחִי מַהֲלַלְאֵל  
אַחֲרֵי הוֹלִידוֹ אֶת־יָרֶד  
שְׁלֹשִׁים שָׁנָה וּשְׁמֹנֶה מֵאוֹת שָׁנָה  
וַיּוֹלֶד בָּנִים וּבָנוֹת

---

#### Transliteration:

_Vayeḥi Mahalal’el  
acharei holido et-Yered  
sheloshim shanah u’shmonah me’ot shanah,  
vayyoleid banim u’vanot._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And Maleleel lived after he begot Jared seven hundred and thirty years, and begot sons and daughters.”

> Again, the LXX **shortens the post-birth lifespan by 100 years**, consistent with its attempt to offset the prior inflation at fatherhood.

---

#### DSS (4QGen-Exoda):

Confirms MT — Mahalal’el lives **830 years after** Yered’s birth.

---

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“Eight hundred and thirty years”**

- Mahalal’el’s total life reaches **895 years**, placing his death in **AM 1290**.
    

> He dies **234 years before the Flood (AM 1656)**, having lived through **Ḥanokh’s entire life** and into the days of Methushelach.

**“And he begot sons and daughters”**

- Continues the pattern of human expansion, ensuring **enormous population growth** and **deep familial networks**.
    

> These unnamed descendants would have played key roles in both righteousness and compromise — their choices impacting the conditions of Genesis 6.

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- LXX’s numerical adjustments consistently distort the **early patriarchal overlap**, which is critical for understanding the **continuity of law, instruction, and accountability** in pre-Flood civilization.
    
- The phrase “sons and daughters” is often skimmed past — yet it sets up the **genetic and moral intermingling** that will soon culminate in divine judgment.

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Mahalal’el’s post-Yered lifespan: AM 460–1290**  
**Total lifespan: 895 years (confirmed next verse)**

> He sees the birth and ministry of Ḥanokh and likely witnesses the rise of corruption tied to the Watchers’ rebellion.

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And Mahalaleel lived after he begat Jared eight hundred and thirty years, and begat sons and daughters.”

**YLT:**  
“And Mahalaleel liveth after his begetting Jared eight hundred and thirty years, and begetteth sons and daughters.”

**NIV:**  
“After he became the father of Jared, Mahalalel lived 830 years and had other sons and daughters.”

> Consistent with MT — though NIV’s “other” is interpretive, not literal.

---

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

**Jubilees 4:18–20** — hints at Mahalal’el’s piety and his role in upholding righteousness in the midst of growing apostasy.

**Genesis 6:1–2** — his unnamed sons and daughters may be involved in the _bene ha-Elohim_ and _daughters of men_ narrative.

**1 Chronicles 1:2** — maintains Mahalal’el in the early patriarchal lineage.
