### **GENESIS 5:10**

_Scroll of the Generations of Adam_  
(Traditional Genesis 5:10)

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And Enosh lived after he begot Qeynan eight hundred and fifteen years, and he begot sons and daughters.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וַיְחִי אֱנוֹשׁ  
אַחֲרֵי הוֹלִידוֹ אֶת־קֵינָן  
חֲמֵשׁ עֶשְׂרֵה שָׁנָה וּשְׁמֹנֶה מֵאוֹת שָׁנָה  
וַיּוֹלֶד בָּנִים וּבָנוֹת

---

#### Transliteration:

_Vayeḥi Enosh  
acharei holido et-Qeynan  
chamesh esreh shanah u’shmonah me’ot shanah,  
vayyoleid banim u’vanot._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And Enos lived after he begot Cainan seven hundred and fifteen years, and begot sons and daughters.”

> Once again, LXX **shortens the post-birth lifespan by 100 years**, attempting to normalize the lifespan despite previously extending the age at fatherhood. This creates internal inconsistencies over time.

---

#### DSS (4QGen-Exoda):

Fully confirms MT — Enosh lived **815 years after** Qeynan’s birth, with **additional sons and daughters** mentioned.

---

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“Eight hundred and fifteen years”**

- Enosh’s life spans **AM 235 (his birth) to AM 1140 (his death)**.
    
- He lives through the birth of **Noaḥ’s grandfather Methushelach** (born AM 687), but **dies before Noaḥ’s father Lamekh is born**.
    

> Like Shet, Enosh spans a large portion of the antediluvian era — a key patriarchal anchor point.

**“And he begot sons and daughters”**

- Continues the expansion of **humanity’s righteous lineage**, distinct from the corrupted line of Qayin.
    
- These additional children would have intermarried within the covenantal community or, in some cases, contributed to the tensions that arise in Genesis 6.
    

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Modern dismissals of early patriarchal ages as “mythic” ignore the deliberate **numerical structure** and **multiplicative record-keeping** style of Genesis 5.
    
- Some scholars suggest “years” were actually months — but that would make Enosh father Qeynan at age 7.5 and die at age 95 — which is even less plausible.
    

> The MT chronology assumes **literal years**, not symbolic ages.

---

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Enosh’s post-Qeynan lifespan: AM 325–1140**

- Total lifespan will be confirmed next at **905 years**.
    
- Enosh’s life overlaps all patriarchs from Adam through Mahalal’el, and most of Yered’s early life.

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And Enos lived after he begat Cainan eight hundred and fifteen years, and begat sons and daughters.”

**YLT:**  
“And Enos liveth after his begetting Cainan eight hundred and fifteen years, and begetteth sons and daughters.”

**NIV:**  
“After he became the father of Kenan, Enosh lived 815 years and had other sons and daughters.”

> All follow MT in data, though NIV’s “other sons and daughters” inserts interpretation not found in the original.

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

**Jubilees 4:15–18** — elaborates on Enosh’s continued teaching of righteousness and his descendants.

**Genesis 6:1–2** — these unnamed “sons and daughters” contribute to the broader human population and later interactions with the _bene ha-Elohim_.

**Psalm 103:15** — “As for Enosh, his days are like grass…” — using _Enosh_ as a poetic image of human frailty and mortality.
