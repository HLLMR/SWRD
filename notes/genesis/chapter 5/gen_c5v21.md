### **GENESIS 5:21**

_Scroll of the Generations of Adam_  
(Traditional Genesis 5:21)

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And Ḥanokh lived sixty-five years, and begot Methushelach.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וַיְחִי חֲנוֹךְ  
חָמֵשׁ וְשִׁשִּׁים שָׁנָה  
וַיּוֹלֶד אֶת־מְתוּשֶׁלַח

---

#### Transliteration:

_Vayeḥi Ḥanokh  
chamesh ve’shishim shanah,  
vayyoleid et-Methushelach._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And Enoch lived one hundred and sixty-five years, and begot Mathusala.”

> The **LXX adds 100 years**, continuing its pattern of chronological inflation. This alters the entire pre-Flood timeline and weakens patriarchal overlap.

---

#### DSS (4QGen-Exoda):

Confirms the MT — Ḥanokh is **65 years old** when Methushelach is born. No deviation.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“Ḥanokh lived sixty-five years…”**

- Ḥanokh is the **seventh from Adam** (Jude 1:14), and this verse sets up his **prophetic authority**.
    

> AM 622 + 65 = **AM 687**, Methushelach’s birth.

- In **Jubilees and 1 Enoch**, this is also the point where Ḥanokh is said to have **begun his formal ministry**, rebuking the wicked and teaching righteousness.
    

**“And begot Methushelach” (מְתוּשֶׁלַח)**

- Name meaning uncertain, but often interpreted as **“man of the dart”**, or more prophetically, **“his death shall bring [it]”**.
    

> This latter meaning would be **profound**, as Methushelach dies the same year the Flood begins (AM 1656) — possibly **marking a divinely appointed delay of judgment** until his death.

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Ḥanokh’s early fatherhood and relatively short life (by antediluvian standards) are downplayed by those who treat his translation (v.24) as myth.
    

> Yet he is **quoted as a prophet** by Jude, included in **Messiah’s lineage** (Luke 3:37), and revered in multiple ancient traditions.

- The name Methushelach is treated superficially in most modern Bibles, with no attention to the **possible prophetic code** embedded in it.
    

---

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Methushelach born at AM 687**

- Adam (d. 930), Yered (d. 962), and Ḥanokh himself are all alive.
    
- This event happens **just decades before Ḥanokh is taken** (AM 987).

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And Enoch lived sixty and five years, and begat Methuselah.”

**YLT:**  
“And Enoch liveth five and sixty years, and begetteth Methuselah.”

**NIV:**  
“When Enoch had lived 65 years, he became the father of Methuselah.”

> All follow MT; only **SWRD’s use of “Ḥanokh” and “Methushelach”** preserves the Hebraic weight of their names.

---

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

**Jude 1:14–15** — directly quotes Ḥanokh’s prophecy of judgment.

**1 Enoch 1–5** — describes his righteousness, visions, and the coming Flood.

**Jubilees 4:23–24** — marks this phase of Ḥanokh’s life as the start of **his ministry of intercession and instruction**.
