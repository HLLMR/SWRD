### **GENESIS 5:7**

_Scroll of the Generations of Adam_  
(Traditional Genesis 5:7)

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And Shet lived after he begot Enosh eight hundred and seven years, and he begot sons and daughters.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וַיְחִי שֵׁת  
אַחֲרֵי הוֹלִידוֹ אֶת־אֱנוֹשׁ  
שֶׁבַע שָׁנִים וּשְׁמֹנֶה מֵאוֹת שָׁנָה  
וַיּוֹלֶד בָּנִים וּבָנוֹת

---

#### Transliteration:

_Vayeḥi Shet  
acharei holido et-Enosh  
sheva shanim u’shmonah me’ot shanah,  
vayyoleid banim u’vanot._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And Seth lived after he begot Enos seven hundred and seven years, and begot sons and daughters.”

> The LXX follows its own earlier inflation — reducing the post-Enosh lifespan to **707 years**, attempting to still arrive at a total lifespan of **912** (as in MT) but reshuffling the numbers.

---

#### DSS (4QGen-Exoda):

Aligns with MT — confirms the figure **807 years** after Enosh’s birth.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“Eight hundred and seven years”**

- These years span from **AM 235 (Enosh’s birth) to AM 1042 (Shet’s death)**.
    
- Shet lives long enough to see **Noaḥ’s father Lamekh born** (AM 874), but dies **14 years before Noaḥ’s birth** (AM 1056).
    

> His life bridges Eden’s generation and the approach of the Flood era.

**“And begot sons and daughters”**

- Reiterates the standard generational formula.
    
- These unnamed children formed the **expanding covenantal community**, likely including key figures not recorded in the Genesis line.
    

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- The LXX’s reduction of Shet’s post-Enosh lifespan obscures the continuity of **living patriarchal witnesses**.
    

> In MT chronology, many generations **overlap significantly**, enabling direct transmission of law and prophecy — an essential idea in Jubilees and Enoch.

- The tendency to skip over the "sons and daughters" diminishes awareness of the **massive population growth** taking place prior to the Flood — a point that becomes critical in Genesis 6.

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**AM 235–1042**

- This span marks **Shet’s post-Enosh years**.
    
- He dies 104 years before the Flood (AM 1656) and **just 14 years before Noaḥ is born**.

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And Seth lived after he begat Enos eight hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters.”

**YLT:**  
“And Seth liveth after his begetting Enos eight hundred and seven years, and begetteth sons and daughters.”

**NIV:**  
“After he became the father of Enosh, Seth lived 807 years and had other sons and daughters.”

> NIV’s “other” is interpretive but sensible. KJV and YLT preserve the **literal structure** of the genealogical formula.

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

**Jubilees 4:13–14** — expands on Shet’s posterity and ethical training of his children.

**Genesis 6:1–2** — these additional “sons and daughters” become the “sons of men” involved in the intermarriage controversy with the _bene ha-Elohim_.

**Luke 3:38** — continues the Shet–Enosh link in Messiah’s ancestry.
