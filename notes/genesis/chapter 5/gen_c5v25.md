### **GENESIS 5:25**

_Scroll of the Generations of Adam_  
(Traditional Genesis 5:25)

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And Methushelach lived one hundred and eighty-seven years, and begot Lamekh.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וַיְחִי מְתוּשֶׁלַח  
שְׁבַע וּשְׁמֹנִים שָׁנָה וּמְאַת שָׁנָה  
וַיּוֹלֶד אֶת־לָמֶךְ

---

#### Transliteration:

_Vayeḥi Methushelach  
sheva u’shmonim shanah u’me’at shanah,  
vayyoleid et-Lamekh._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And Mathusala lived one hundred and sixty-seven years, and begot Lamech.”

> The **LXX shaves 20 years off** Methushelach’s age at fatherhood, creating a **severe conflict** with Flood chronology.

> If Lamekh were born 20 years earlier, Methushelach would die **before** the Flood — contradicting Genesis 7:11, which shows he dies the same year.

---

#### DSS (4QGen-Exoda):

Confirms the **MT** — Methushelach fathers Lamekh at **187 years old**, aligning with the broader Genesis chronology.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“One hundred and eighty-seven years”**

- Methushelach is the **longest-lived man** in recorded Scripture — his timeline is critical for anchoring the **pre-Flood world**.
    

> Lamekh’s birth occurs in **AM 874** (687 + 187), during the final years of:

- Adam (dies AM 930)
    
- Yered (dies AM 962)
    
- Possibly overlapping Ḥanokh’s final decades (until AM 987)
    

**“And begot Lamekh” (לָמֶךְ)**

- Name likely means **“strong,” “despairing,” or “to strike down.”**
    

> Multiple traditions view Lamekh’s naming as prophetic — either foretelling **relief** from the cursed ground (Genesis 5:29) or hinting at **the violence of the era** (cf. Lamekh in Cain’s line).

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- The LXX’s date change breaks Genesis 5’s math, and by extension, **undermines Noahic chronology**.
    

> Genesis 7:11 says the Flood begins when **Noaḥ is 600**. If Methushelach is Lamekh’s father at **167**, he would die **14 years before** the Flood.

> The MT preserves **perfect harmony**:  
> → 187 (to Lamekh)

- 182 (to Noaḥ)
    
- 600 (to Flood)  
    = **969** (Methushelach’s full lifespan)
    

---

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Lamekh born at AM 874**

- He will father Noaḥ at AM 1056.
    
- Methushelach will live to **AM 1656**, the exact year the Flood begins — making him a **symbol of divine patience**.

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And Methuselah lived an hundred eighty and seven years, and begat Lamech.”

**YLT:**  
“And Methuselah liveth an hundred and eighty and seven years, and begetteth Lamech.”

**NIV:**  
“When Methuselah had lived 187 years, he became the father of Lamech.”

> All agree with MT here — though **only MT-based renderings** can support the **Flood-year alignment**.

---

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

**Genesis 5:29** — Lamekh’s naming explanation connects his identity to Noah’s coming role.

**Jubilees 4:27–28** — speaks of Methushelach’s wisdom and righteousness, even in an increasingly corrupt age.

**1 Enoch 68–70** — notes Methushelach as recipient of Ḥanokh’s final messages and seer of judgment.
