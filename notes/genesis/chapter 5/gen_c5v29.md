### **GENESIS 5:29**

_Scroll of the Generations of Adam_  
(Traditional Genesis 5:29)

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And he called his name Noaḥ, saying, “This one shall comfort us concerning our work and the toil of our hands, from the ground which YHWH has cursed.”**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וַיִּקְרָא אֶת־שְׁמוֹ נֹחַ לֵאמֹר  
זֶה יְנַחֲמֵנוּ מִמַּעֲשֵׂנוּ  
וּמֵעִצְּבוֹן יָדֵינוּ  
מִן־הָאֲדָמָה אֲשֶׁר אֵרְרָהּ יְהוָה

---

#### Transliteration:

_Vayyiqra et-shemo Noaḥ, le’mor,  
zeh yenaḥamenu mi’ma’aseinu,  
u’me’itzvon yadeinu,  
min ha’adamah asher ererah YHWH._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And he called his name Noe, saying, ‘This one shall comfort us in our works, and in the toil of our hands, and because of the earth which the Lord God has cursed.’”

> The LXX is close to MT, though it slightly reorders and expands phrases — possibly to harmonize with Greek idiom. The meaning is preserved.

---

#### DSS (4QGen-Exoda):

Matches the MT — the naming of **Noaḥ** is explicitly linked to **comfort (נחם / nacham)**, and references the **curse on the ground**.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“He called his name Noaḥ” (נֹחַ)**

- Name derives from _nacham_ (נחם) — to comfort, console, or bring relief.
    

> This is the only child in Genesis 5 whose **name is immediately explained** — and the explanation is **prophetic**.

- Lamekh speaks in a **thematic triad**:
    
    1. Our works
        
    2. The pain of our hands
        
    3. The cursed ground
        

> Each echoes **Genesis 3:17–19**, suggesting Lamekh sees Noaḥ as a potential **reverser of the curse** — or at least a **preserver** through judgment.

**“From the ground which YHWH has cursed”**

- Strong allusion to **Genesis 3:17**, where YHWH curses the ground because of Adam’s sin.
    

> The use of **YHWH** here (not just Elohim) signals **covenantal awareness** — Lamekh is invoking not just the Creator, but the Covenant-Keeper.

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Most modern commentaries dismiss this verse as a parent’s emotional hope — but the precision of the language points to **divinely inspired foresight**.
    

> Jubilees and 1 Enoch preserve ancient traditions of Lamekh receiving visions and dreams about Noaḥ’s unique purpose.

- The connection between **Noaḥ and “comfort”** is linguistic and theological — a foreshadowing of **restoration, cleansing, and new creation**.
    

---

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Noaḥ named in AM 1056**

- The curse still reigns, but hope begins to emerge — not through rebellion, but through one man’s righteousness (cf. Genesis 6:8–9).

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And he called his name Noah, saying, This same shall comfort us concerning our work and toil of our hands, because of the ground which the Lord hath cursed.”

**YLT:**  
“And he calleth his name Noah, saying, ‘This one doth comfort us concerning our work, and concerning the labour of our hands, because of the ground which Jehovah hath cursed.’”

**NIV:**  
“He named him Noah and said, ‘He will comfort us in the labor and painful toil of our hands caused by the ground the Lord has cursed.’”

> KJV and YLT preserve the tone and cadence. NIV simplifies for readability but loses some of the layered structure.

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

**Genesis 6:8–9** — confirms that Noaḥ “found grace” and “walked with Elohim,” affirming Lamekh’s prophetic hope.

**Jubilees 4:28–30** — expands on Lamekh’s prophetic understanding and notes that Noaḥ would be preserved through divine judgment.

**1 Enoch 106–107** — portrays Noaḥ as a radiant, unusual child; Lamekh is deeply disturbed, and Methushelach consults Ḥanokh for interpretation.
