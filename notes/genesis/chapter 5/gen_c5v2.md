### **GENESIS 5:2**

_Scroll of the Generations of Adam_  
(Traditional Genesis 5:2)

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**Male and female He created them, and He blessed them, and called their name Adam in the day they were created.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

זָכָר וּנְקֵבָה בְּרָאָם  
וַיְבָרֶךְ אֹתָם  
וַיִּקְרָא אֶת־שְׁמָם אָדָם  
בְּיוֹם הִבָּרְאָם

---

#### Transliteration:

_Zachar u’neqevah b’ra’am,  
vayevarekh otam,  
vayyiqra et-shemam Adam  
b’yom hibaram._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“Male and female He created them, and blessed them: and He called their name Adam in the day in which He made them.”

> LXX matches MT closely here — no meaningful deviation.

---

#### DSS (4QGen-Exoda):

Fully consistent with MT. The phrase “vayyiqra et-shemam Adam” is clearly preserved, affirming the collective naming.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“Male and female He created them” (זָכָר וּנְקֵבָה בְּרָאָם)**

- Recapitulates **Genesis 1:27** and **Genesis 2** — a divine reiteration, not a new creation event.
    
- Confirms the unity and duality of humanity in its original form — created as complementary image-bearers.
    

**“He blessed them” (וַיְבָרֶךְ אֹתָם)**

- Blessing language matches Gen 1:28 — tied to fruitfulness and dominion.
    
- Again affirms that the **blessing was given to both**, not solely to Adam as an individual.
    

**“And called their name Adam” (וַיִּקְרָא אֶת־שְׁמָם אָדָם)**

- Plural: “their name” — yet singular: “Adam.”
    
- _Adam_ functions here as a **collective identity**, not merely a personal name.
    

> The **entire human pair** is called _Adam_ — emphasizing the unity of the human race under that name.

- This also reinforces the **role of the man** as representative head (cf. Romans 5:12) — but it does not erase Havvah’s identity.
    

**“In the day they were created” (בְּיוֹם הִבָּרְאָם)**

- Recaps **Day 6**.
    
- Stylistic repetition used throughout this genealogical section to create **liturgical rhythm** and legal tone.

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Some traditions have subtly downplayed the **gender unity** expressed in this verse, emphasizing Adam’s naming of Havvah as a separate event of dominion — yet **here Elohim names them both Adam**, not just the male.
    

> This counters misogynistic misreadings and emphasizes **shared origin and blessing**, even within hierarchical structure.

- Additionally, the singular naming has been largely overlooked as a **theological anchor for federal headship**, which Paul draws on in Romans.

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**AM 0** — Day 6 of creation, being referenced retrospectively.

This verse still operates as a **prologue** to the genealogy proper, which begins in the next verse.

---

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“Male and female created He them; and blessed them, and called their name Adam, in the day when they were created.”

**YLT:**  
“Male and female He hath prepared them, and He blesseth them, and calleth their name Man in the day of their being prepared.”

**NIV:**  
“He created them male and female and blessed them. And He named them ‘Mankind’ when they were created.”

> **NIV diverges heavily** — translating _Adam_ as “Mankind.” While semantically acceptable, it **strips the proper name context**, which is essential to covenantal theology.

---

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

**Genesis 1:27–28** — creation and blessing of male and female.

**Genesis 2:23** — naming of woman as “Ishah,” which contrasts here with _Elohim’s_ own naming of both as _Adam_.

**Romans 5:12–19**, **1 Corinthians 15:22** — Paul’s theology of Adam as the representative human links directly to this verse.

**Jubilees 3:8–11** — elaborates on the blessing of Adam and Havvah together and links their unity to covenant observance.
