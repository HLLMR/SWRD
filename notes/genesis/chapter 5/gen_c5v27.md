### **GENESIS 5:27**

_Scroll of the Generations of Adam_  
(Traditional Genesis 5:27)

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And all the days of Methushelach were nine hundred and sixty-nine years, and he died.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וַיְהִי כָּל יְמֵי מְתוּשֶׁלַח  
תְּשַׁע מֵאוֹת שָׁנָה וְתִשְׁעִים שָׁנָה  
וַיָּמֹת

---

#### Transliteration:

_Vayehi kol yemei Methushelach  
teshaʿ me’ot shanah ve’tishʿim shanah,  
vayyamot._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And all the days of Mathusala which he lived were nine hundred and sixty-nine years, and he died.”

> LXX agrees with MT here — the **final number is correct**, even though the earlier data was manipulated to reach it.

---

#### DSS (4QGen-Exoda):

Fully confirms the MT — Methushelach lived **969 years**, ending with the standard death formula.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“Nine hundred and sixty-nine years”**

- The **longest recorded human lifespan** in Scripture.
    

> This is not arbitrary:

- Methushelach is the **bridge between Ḥanokh and Noaḥ**, and the last patriarch to die before the Flood.
    
- He outlives Adam, Shet, Enosh, Qeynan, Mahalal’el, Yered, Ḥanokh, and his own son Lamekh.
    

> His name is traditionally interpreted (though etymologically debated) as **“his death shall bring [it]”** — a **possible prophecy of the Flood**.

**“And he died” (וַיָּמֹת)**

- His death marks the **end of the long-suffering patience of YHWH** (cf. 1 Peter 3:20).
    

> Genesis 7:11 states the Flood began the same year Methushelach died — **AM 1656**.

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- The significance of Methushelach’s name and timing is rarely taught.
    

> The precision of Genesis 5 is often dismissed as myth or editorial construction, but this final data point **validates the timeline’s internal consistency**.

- LXX’s data adjustments fail under scrutiny, causing Methushelach’s death to occur **before** the Flood — contradicting Genesis 7:11 and undermining typological structure.
    

---

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Methushelach dies at AM 1656 — the year of the Flood.**

- Noaḥ is 600 years old (Genesis 7:6), Methushelach is 969.
    
- His death is likely timed **just before the rains fall**, symbolizing the **last breath of mercy before judgment**.

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And all the days of Methuselah were nine hundred sixty and nine years: and he died.”

**YLT:**  
“And all the days of Methuselah are nine hundred and sixty and nine years, and he dieth.”

**NIV:**  
“Altogether, Methuselah lived a total of 969 years, and then he died.”

> All reflect the MT’s number. KJV and YLT preserve the solemn cadence that anchors the genealogy.

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

**1 Enoch 68–71** — records Methushelach’s role in preserving Ḥanokh’s visions and teachings.

**Jubilees 4:27–28** — credits him with righteousness and endurance in a time of corruption.

**2 Peter 3:9–10** — echoes the spirit of divine delay: “YHWH is not slack concerning His promise… but is long-suffering…” — Methushelach embodies that long-suffering.
