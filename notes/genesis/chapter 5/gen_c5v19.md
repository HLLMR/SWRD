### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“Eight hundred years after he begot Ḥanokh”**

- Yered lives from **AM 460 to AM 962**, and sees:
    
    - Ḥanokh’s full 365-year walk with Elohim (to AM 987),
        
    - Methushelach’s youth and adulthood,
        
    - The generation just before Noaḥ.
        

> Yered is the **last patriarch to outlive Adam** (who dies at AM 930).  
> He also lives through **Shet, Enosh, Qeynan, and Mahalal’el** — and most likely had contact with **Noaḥ’s father Lamekh** (born AM 874).

**“And begot sons and daughters”**

- This generation is **key** to the Genesis 6 narrative.
    

> If the _bene ha-Elohim_ fell “in the days of Yered,” as Jubilees and 1 Enoch suggest, then **his children** were among the first to **intermarry with the Watchers**, initiating the Nephilim era.

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Many traditional commentators skip over Yered entirely, but his life **anchors the onset of the pre-Flood apostasy**.
    

> His name means **“descent”** — likely linked to the _descent of the Watchers_ on Mount Hermon (cf. 1 Enoch 6:6).

- The repeated “sons and daughters” phrase becomes especially significant here, as it directly connects to Genesis 6:1–2.

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Yered’s post-Ḥanokh years: AM 622–962**  
**Total lifespan: 962 years** (confirmed in next verse)

> His death comes **69 years before the Flood** (AM 1656), and **25 years before Noaḥ is born** (AM 1056).

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And Jared lived after he begat Enoch eight hundred years, and begat sons and daughters.”

**YLT:**  
“And Jared liveth after his begetting Enoch eight hundred years, and begetteth sons and daughters.”

**NIV:**  
“After he became the father of Enoch, Jared lived 800 years and had other sons and daughters.”

> NIV’s phrasing is looser but accurate. KJV and YLT preserve the ritual cadence of Genesis 5.

---

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

**Jubilees 4:15–22** — expands on Yered’s generation and the descent of the Watchers.

**1 Enoch 6–7** — names the Watchers and connects their descent to “the days of Yered.”

**Genesis 6:1–2** — likely involves Yered’s “sons and daughters” directly in the narrative setup.
