### **GENESIS 5:31**

_Scroll of the Generations of Adam_  
(Traditional Genesis 5:31)

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And all the days of Lamekh were seven hundred and seventy-seven years, and he died.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וַיְהִי כָּל יְמֵי לָמֶךְ  
שֶׁבַע מֵאוֹת שָׁנָה וְשִׁבְעִים שָׁנָה וְשֶׁבַע שָׁנִים  
וַיָּמֹת

---

#### Transliteration:

_Vayehi kol yemei Lamekh  
sheva me’ot shanah ve’shivʿim shanah ve’sheva shanim,  
vayyamot._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And all the days of Lamech were seven hundred and fifty-three years, and he died.”

> LXX **incorrectly totals 753 years**, matching its earlier changes:

- It reduced Lamekh’s fatherhood age by +6 (188 vs. 182)
    
- And his post-Noaḥ life by −30 (565 vs. 595)  
    → 188 + 565 = 753, but **breaks the MT structure and Flood alignment**.
    

---

#### DSS (4QGen-Exoda):

Affirms MT — Lamekh lives **777 years**, dying shortly before the Flood.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“Seven hundred and seventy-seven years” (שׁבע מאות שבעים ושבע)**

- Highly **symbolic** number:
    
    - 7 = completion, perfection, divine fullness
        
    - Triple repetition magnifies it: **perfectly completed life** under judgment
        

> Lamekh’s lifespan foreshadows the coming **sealing of an age** — he dies just **5 years before the Flood**.

**“And he died”**

- Ends the pattern of patriarchal deaths in Genesis 5 — the next figure (Noaḥ) breaks the line by surviving the Flood.
    

> Lamekh’s death is not just an end — it’s the **threshold** before divine reckoning.

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- LXX truncates this number to 753, **severing its symbolic resonance** and disrupting Genesis 5’s structured numeric precision.
    

> The **triple-seven** is not coincidental — it mirrors other sevens (Sabbath, jubilees, forgiveness cycles) that **define YHWH’s order**.

- Few modern expositors explore this — yet it **prepares the reader** for a righteous remnant (Noaḥ) emerging from a line of **divinely patterned lifespans**.

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Lamekh dies at AM 1651**, 5 years before the Flood (AM 1656)

> Noaḥ is **595 years old** when his father dies  
> Methushelach still lives for **5 more years**, dying in the Flood year

---

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And all the days of Lamech were seven hundred seventy and seven years: and he died.”

**YLT:**  
“And all the days of Lamech are seven hundred and seventy and seven years, and he dieth.”

**NIV:**  
“Altogether, Lamech lived a total of 777 years, and then he died.”

> All follow MT. NIV flattens the cadence; KJV and YLT retain the structured narrative rhythm.

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

**Genesis 6:1–5** — follows immediately with the rise of Nephilim and judgment decree — set in motion as the final patriarchs pass.

**Jubilees 5:1–2** — emphasizes that corruption reached a peak shortly after Lamekh’s death.

**1 Enoch 106–107** — sees Lamekh as troubled and prophetic — his departure precedes the unraveling of order.
