### **GENESIS 5:3**

_Scroll of the Generations of Adam_  
(Traditional Genesis 5:3)

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And Adam lived one hundred and thirty years, and begot a son in his own likeness, according to his image, and called his name Shet.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וַיְחִי אָדָם שְׁלֹשִׁים וּמְאַת שָׁנָה  
וַיּוֹלֶד בִּדְמוּתוֹ כְּצַלְמוֹ  
וַיִּקְרָא אֶת־שְׁמוֹ שֵׁת

---

#### Transliteration:

_Vayeḥi Adam sheloshim u’me’at shanah,  
vayyoleid bid’muto k’tzalmo,  
vayyiqra et-shemo Shet._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And Adam lived two hundred and thirty years, and begot a son after his own form, and after his own image, and he called his name Seth.”

> The LXX diverges here by stating **230 years**, not 130 — an important **chronological discrepancy** with major timeline implications.

---

#### DSS (4QGen-Exoda):

Aligns with MT — confirms **130 years** as Adam’s age at Shet’s birth, and retains “in his likeness, according to his image.”

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“Adam lived 130 years…”**

- Anchors the **first AM timestamp** in this chapter: **AM 130**, the year Shet is born.
    
- This confirms that **Qayin and Havel were born earlier**, long before this genealogical line is formalized.
    

**“In his likeness, according to his image” (בִּדְמוּתוֹ כְּצַלְמוֹ)**

- _Demut_ = resemblance in form, _Tzelem_ = image or imprint — same words used of **Elohim’s creation of Adam** in Genesis 1:26–27.
    
- Suggests Shet bears Adam’s **physical and spiritual inheritance** — a transmission of **human nature**, now post-Fall.
    

> Some commentators see a subtle **shift**: Adam was created in Elohim’s image, while Shet is in Adam’s — marking the onset of **generational corruption** and mortality.

**“He called his name Shet” (שֵׁת)**

- Meaning = “appointed” or “placed.”
    
- Same rationale Eve gives in Genesis 4:25.

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- **LXX’s error** (230 years instead of 130) throws off all subsequent genealogical math in ancient chronologies — contributing to major timeline confusion between MT, LXX, and Samaritan Pentateuch.
    

> SWRD follows the MT chronology unless multiple witnesses prove otherwise — so this remains **AM 130** for Shet’s birth.

- Some traditions downplay the phrase “in his image,” interpreting it purely biologically — but this clearly **echoes the divine image language**, indicating a **theological transmission** as well.
    

---

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**AM 130**

- The first precise time anchor post-Eden.
    
- Shet is born **as a replacement for Havel**, marking the rise of the righteous lineage from which Noaḥ and Messiah will descend.

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And Adam lived an hundred and thirty years, and begat a son in his own likeness, after his image; and called his name Seth.”

**YLT:**  
“And Adam liveth an hundred and thirty years, and begetteth in his likeness, according to his image, and calleth his name Seth.”

**NIV:**  
“When Adam had lived 130 years, he had a son in his own likeness, in his own image; and he named him Seth.”

> All major versions correctly retain “130” and preserve the core structure — **but none highlight the theological echo** of Genesis 1.

---

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

**Genesis 1:26–27** — Elohim creates man in His image.

**Genesis 4:25** — Eve’s naming of Shet as replacement for Havel.

**Luke 3:38** — Yeshua’s genealogy ends with “Shet, the son of Adam, the son of Elohim.”

**Jubilees 4:7** — details Shet’s righteousness and his role in preserving the commands of Elohim.
