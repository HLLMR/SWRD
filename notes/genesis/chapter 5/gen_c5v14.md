### **GENESIS 5:14**

_Scroll of the Generations of Adam_  
(Traditional Genesis 5:14)

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And all the days of Qeynan were nine hundred and ten years, and he died.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וַיְהִי כָּל יְמֵי קֵינָן  
תְּשַׁע מֵאוֹת שָׁנָה וְעֶשֶׂר שָׁנִים  
וַיָּמֹת

---

#### Transliteration:

_Vayehi kol yemei Qeynan  
teshaʿ me’ot shanah veʿeser shanim,  
vayyamot._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And all the days of Cainan were nine hundred and ten years, and he died.”

> LXX agrees with the MT here despite shifting earlier numbers — this is a mathematical patch that doesn’t resolve its larger genealogical drift.

---

#### DSS (4QGen-Exoda):

Confirms the MT — Qeynan’s total lifespan is **910 years**, consistent with 70 (v.12) + 840 (v.13).

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“All the days of Qeynan…”**

- Final summary of his life — the standard death formula continues.
    

> This formula marks the **inevitability of mortality** — even the line of the righteous cannot escape the curse passed down from Adam.

**“Nine hundred and ten years”**

- Solid MT math:  
    → 70 (to Mahalal’el) + 840 (post-Mahalal’el) = 910
    

> Qeynan’s death occurs in **AM 895**, during Mahalal’el’s adulthood and before Yered’s fatherhood begins.

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Critics often reduce Genesis 5 to myth due to the lifespans, but the **consistency, repetition, and internal math** suggest deliberate scribal recording — not folklore.
    
- The LXX’s attempt to harmonize totals (while altering inputs) creates **timeline instability** that doesn’t hold up under scrutiny — especially once compared to Jubilees or the NT genealogies.
    

---

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Qeynan dies at AM 895**

- Lives during the generation of **Yered’s youth**, and within decades of Adam’s death.
    

> He represents the **fifth full patriarch** from Adam — a bridge from pre-Fall knowledge to pre-Flood corruption.

---

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And all the days of Cainan were nine hundred and ten years: and he died.”

**YLT:**  
“And all the days of Cainan are nine hundred and ten years, and he dieth.”

**NIV:**  
“Altogether, Kenan lived a total of 910 years, and then he died.”

> All agree with MT. The KJV and YLT retain the solemn death cadence more faithfully.

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

**Genesis 3:19** — “Dust you are, and to dust you shall return” — each patriarch’s death reinforces this decree.

**Romans 5:14** — “Death reigned from Adam to Moses…” — includes Qeynan, a righteous man who nonetheless died under the inherited curse.

**Jubilees 4:18** — briefly records Qeynan’s death and notes his fear of Elohim and his observance of law.
