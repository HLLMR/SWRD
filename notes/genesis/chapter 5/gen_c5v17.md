### **GENESIS 5:17**

_Scroll of the Generations of Adam_  
(Traditional Genesis 5:17)

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And all the days of Mahalal’el were eight hundred and ninety-five years, and he died.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וַיְהִי כָּל יְמֵי מַהֲלַלְאֵל  
שְׁמֹנֶה מֵאוֹת שָׁנָה וְתִשְׁעִים חָמֵשׁ שָׁנָה  
וַיָּמֹת

---

#### Transliteration:

_Vayehi kol yemei Mahalal’el  
shemoneh me’ot shanah ve’tishʿim chamesh shanah,  
vayyamot._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And all the days of Maleleel were eight hundred and ninety-five years, and he died.”

> LXX aligns here with the MT, even though it previously altered input values. The output total remains **895 years** in both traditions.

---

#### DSS (4QGen-Exoda):

Confirms MT — total lifespan of **895 years**, death formula intact.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“All the days of Mahalal’el…”**

- Standard phrasing for closing a patriarchal life — emphasizing the **certainty of death**, even for the righteous line.
    

**“Eight hundred and ninety-five years”**

- Matches internal math:  
    → 65 (Yered’s birth) + 830 (post-Yered) = 895
    

**“And he died” (וַיָּמֹת)**

- Sixth occurrence of this phrase in the genealogy — preparing us for a **break in the pattern** when Ḥanokh’s record appears.
    

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- In traditions that treat Genesis 5 as symbolic or poetic, this verse is viewed as stylized — yet the **numerical structure** is precise and echoes **legal recording conventions** (like priestly registries or inheritance records).
    
- Critics who question the early biblical record rarely address the fact that **both MT and LXX agree on the total lifespan here**, showing that **some numbers were preserved even in competing traditions**.

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Mahalal’el dies at AM 1290**

- Adam is long dead (since AM 930), but **Shet, Enosh, and Qeynan have only recently died** — and **Yered, Ḥanokh, and Methushelach** are alive.
    

> He dies 366 years before the Flood and **about 65 years before Ḥanokh is taken**.

---

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And all the days of Mahalaleel were eight hundred ninety and five years: and he died.”

**YLT:**  
“And all the days of Mahalaleel are eight hundred and ninety and five years, and he dieth.”

**NIV:**  
“Altogether, Mahalalel lived a total of 895 years, and then he died.”

> All maintain MT numbers; NIV’s phrase “then he died” flattens the weight of _vayyamot_.

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

**Jubilees 4:19–20** — records Mahalal’el’s death and his warnings about apostasy.

**Romans 5:12–14** — again affirms the reign of death from Adam through all generations, building tension toward the coming exception in Ḥanokh.
