### **GENESIS 5:13**

_Scroll of the Generations of Adam_  
(Traditional Genesis 5:13)

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And Qeynan lived after he begot Mahalal’el eight hundred and forty years, and he begot sons and daughters.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וַיְחִי קֵינָן  
אַחֲרֵי הוֹלִידוֹ אֶת־מַהֲלַלְאֵל  
שְׁמוֹנֶה מֵאוֹת שָׁנָה וְאַרְבָּעִים שָׁנָה  
וַיּוֹלֶד בָּנִים וּבָנוֹת

---

#### Transliteration:

_Vayeḥi Qeynan  
acharei holido et-Mahalal’el  
shemoneh me’ot shanah ve’arbaʿim shanah,  
vayyoleid banim u’vanot._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And Cainan lived after he begot Maleleel seven hundred and forty years, and begot sons and daughters.”

> LXX again **subtracts 100 years** from the MT’s post-birth lifespan, in order to **offset** the earlier inflation in v.12. Despite that, the totals still tend to diverge in other generations.

---

#### DSS (4QGen-Exoda):

Fully supports the MT. Qeynan lived **840 years after** Mahalal’el was born, and begot **multiple children**, plural.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“Eight hundred and forty years”**

- Qeynan lives from **AM 325 to AM 895**.
    
- He dies **just 35 years before Adam** (AM 930), and lives through the early years of Yered (AM 460) and into the generation just preceding Ḥanokh.
    

> His lifespan is second-longest so far, surpassed only by Adam (930) and eventually Methushelach (969).

**“And he begot sons and daughters”**

- This repeated phrase is **deliberate** — a formal register acknowledging **non-lineal offspring**.
    
- These descendants would have played a major role in the **population surge** prior to the Flood and may be part of the “daughters of men” narrative of Genesis 6.
    

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- The LXX’s manipulation here continues its trend of **distorting patriarchal overlap**, which is **essential** to understanding the integrity of pre-Flood covenantal transmission.
    
- Qeynan’s contribution is often skipped in teachings, yet his role as **father to Mahalal’el (“El is praised”)** suggests a **generation of worship renewal** that resists early corruption.
    

---

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Qeynan’s post-Mahalal’el years: AM 395–895**  
**Death at AM 895**

- Dies 35 years before Adam and 61 years before Shet.
    
- Lived to see at least **six generations** of his descendants born.

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And Cainan lived after he begat Mahalaleel eight hundred and forty years, and begat sons and daughters.”

**YLT:**  
“And Cainan liveth after his begetting Mahalaleel eight hundred and forty years, and begetteth sons and daughters.”

**NIV:**  
“After he became the father of Mahalalel, Kenan lived 840 years and had other sons and daughters.”

> Consistent with MT, but NIV again weakens the repeated **liturgical cadence** by paraphrasing.

---

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

**Jubilees 4:16–18** — elaborates on Qeynan’s righteousness and possible role in preserving sacred records.

**Genesis 6:1–2** — these “sons and daughters” become critical in the **Watcher-human hybrid narrative**, depending on how the phrase _bene ha-Elohim_ is interpreted.

**Luke 3:37** — preserves Qeynan in Yeshua’s royal and priestly lineage.
