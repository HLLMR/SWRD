### **GENESIS 5:20**

_Scroll of the Generations of Adam_  
(Traditional Genesis 5:20)

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And all the days of Yered were nine hundred and sixty-two years, and he died.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וַיְהִי כָּל יְמֵי יָרֶד  
תְּשַׁע מֵאוֹת שָׁנָה וּשְׁתַּיִם שָׁנָה  
וַיָּמֹת

---

#### Transliteration:

_Vayehi kol yemei Yered  
teshaʿ me’ot shanah u’shtayim shanah,  
vayyamot._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And all the days of Jared were nine hundred and sixty-two years, and he died.”

> LXX matches MT — despite previous lifespan shifts in other patriarchs.

---

#### DSS (4QGen-Exoda):

Fully confirms the MT — Yered’s lifespan is **962 years**, and ends with the formulaic “and he died.”

---

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“All the days of Yered…”**

- One of the **longest lifespans** in Genesis 5 — second only to Methushelach.
    
- Confirms earlier math:  
    → 162 (to Ḥanokh) + 800 (post-Ḥanokh) = 962
    

**“And he died” (וַיָּמֹת)**

- A grim **return to the death rhythm** of Genesis 5, just before it is broken by Ḥanokh in v.24.
    

> Yered’s death comes **well into the corruption era** that Ḥanokh would confront, and Methushelach would endure.

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Yered’s name and timing are too often ignored — yet he bookends the **descent of the Watchers**, the rise of Ḥanokh, and the coming judgment.
    
- Ancient texts like 1 Enoch and Jubilees recognize his era as **critical** — the generation where Heaven and Earth **first collided in rebellion**.
    

---

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Yered dies at AM 962**

- Just **69 years before the Flood** (AM 1656).
    

> He lived through the days of Ḥanokh, Methushelach, and **likely witnessed the earliest signs of Nephilim corruption**.

---

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And all the days of Jared were nine hundred sixty and two years: and he died.”

**YLT:**  
“And all the days of Jared are nine hundred and sixty and two years, and he dieth.”

**NIV:**  
“Altogether, Jared lived a total of 962 years, and then he died.”

> All are faithful to MT. KJV/YLT preserve the **ritual cadence** of the text.

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

**Jubilees 4:22** — confirms Yered’s death and associates his generation with divine descent and rising lawlessness.

**1 Enoch 6–7** — situates the rebellion of the Watchers **within Yered’s era**, giving eschatological weight to his generation.

**Genesis 6:1–2** — Yered’s sons and daughters may have participated (willingly or not) in the corruption described there.
