### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**Verse 21 — Provision and Preparation**

- **“Take for yourself…”** — Noaḥ must **act intentionally**; divine grace still requires **human participation**.
    
- **“Every kind of food that is eaten”** — implies:
    
    - Diversity of food types (grains, dried fruits, seeds, etc.)
        
    - Possibly a **pre-clean/unclean awareness**, later formalized in Leviticus.
        
- **“You shall gather it to yourself”** — Noaḥ is made **provider and steward**, reflecting **Adam’s role** in the garden.
    

> This echoes the Edenic mandate to **tend and keep** — Noaḥ is tasked with **sustaining life during judgment**.

---

**Verse 22 — Obedience without Hesitation**

- **“And Noaḥ did according to all…”** — Hebrew: **וַיַּעַשׂ (vayyaʿas)** — he _acted_, _executed_, _fulfilled_.
    
- The phrase **“כְּכֹל אֲשֶׁר צִוָּה” (ke’khol asher tzivah)** — “according to all that He commanded” — signals **total obedience**.
    

> This mirrors **Moses** later in Exodus (e.g., Ex. 40:16), reinforcing Noaḥ as a **covenant archetype**.

- **“So he did” (כֵּן עָשָׂה)** — emphatic conclusion. No hesitation, negotiation, or deviation.
    

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Some retellings overemphasize **ark construction** while ignoring **logistics of long-term survival** — but food provision is just as critical in YHWH’s plan.
    

> This isn't mythic magic — it's practical, ordered, and divinely guided **preservation engineering**.

- Others view Noaḥ as a passive figure — but verse 22 makes clear: Noaḥ is a **man of decisive action**, rooted in faith.
    

---

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Final days before AM 1656**

- The ark is now fully constructed, provisioned, and occupied. The **next event is the arrival of the Flood** (Genesis 7:1–10).

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
21. “And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them.”  
22. “Thus did Noah; according to all that God commanded him, so did he.”

**YLT:**  
21. “And thou, take to thyself of all food that is eaten, and thou hast gathered unto thee, and it hath been to thee and to them for food.”  
22. “And Noah doth according to all that God hath commanded him; so hath he done.”

**NIV:**  
21. “You are to take every kind of food that is to be eaten and store it away as food for you and for them.”  
22. “Noah did everything just as God commanded him.”

> NIV softens the repetition of “so he did,” but preserves the meaning. KJV/YLT stay closest to the Hebrew cadence.

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

- **Exodus 16** — YHWH provides **daily food in the wilderness**, mirroring the ark's provision for life in isolation.
    
- **Matthew 24:45–47** — “faithful and wise servant… gives them food in due season” — Noaḥ prefigures this righteous steward.
    
- **Hebrews 11:7** — “By faith Noaḥ… prepared an ark…” — faith **produces obedience**, not passivity.
    

> This closing verse of Genesis 6 seals Noaḥ’s legacy: **a man of faith, foresight, obedience, and provision** — the chosen steward of post-Flood renewal.
