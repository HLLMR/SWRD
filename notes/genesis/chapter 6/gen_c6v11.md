### **GENESIS 6:11**

_Scroll of Noaḥ_  
(Traditional Genesis 6:11)

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And the earth was corrupt before Elohim, and the earth was filled with violence.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וַתִּשָּׁחֵת הָאָרֶץ  
לִפְנֵי הָאֱלֹהִים  
וַתִּמָּלֵא הָאָרֶץ חָמָס

---

#### Transliteration:

_Vattishachet ha’aretz  
lifnei haElohim,  
vattimmale ha’aretz ḥamas._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“But the earth was corrupted before God, and the earth was filled with iniquity.”

> LXX uses **ἀνομίας (anomias)** — lawlessness — which sharpens the legal and moral dimensions of **ḥamas (חָמָס)**.

---

#### DSS (4QGen):

DSS confirms MT’s phrasing. “ḥamas” (violence, injustice) is **untranslated** in many cases due to its **uniquely loaded connotation** in biblical Hebrew.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“The earth was corrupt before Elohim”**

- **שָׁחַת (shachat)** — same root used for decay, ruin, moral perversion, and **genetic defilement**.
    

> This is not mere wickedness; it suggests a **fundamental unraveling of created order** — likely due to Nephilim hybrids, occult practices, and bloodshed.

- “Before Elohim” emphasizes that this corruption is **cosmically visible and judicially offensive**.

**“The earth was filled with violence (ḥamas)”**

- **חָמָס (ḥamas)** — more than physical violence:
    
    - Injustice
        
    - Lawless oppression
        
    - Violation of moral and divine boundaries
        
- **Used throughout the prophets** to describe societies under **covenant judgment** (cf. Ezekiel 7:23, Amos 3:10).
    

> The world has become **unrecognizable** from what YHWH made — not only violent, but **systemically corrupted**.

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Many translations use “violence” generically, but **ḥamas** denotes a **pattern of domination, injustice, and bloodshed** — the **hallmark of Nephilim rule**.
    
- Some modern theologians hesitate to link this to angelic/hybrid corruption, yet that is the consistent witness of **Enoch, Jubilees, and Peter/Jude**.
    

> The text demands we see this as a **comprehensive desecration** — physical, moral, and spiritual.

---

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**AM 1650–1656**

- Within the **final window before the Flood** — conditions have peaked in their corruption.
    
- The ark commission will follow immediately as **YHWH prepares to purge the land**.

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“The earth also was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence.”

**YLT:**  
“And the earth is corrupt before God, and the earth is filled [with] violence.”

**NIV:**  
“Now the earth was corrupt in God’s sight and was full of violence.”

> All capture the general structure. Only KJV and YLT preserve the **sense of divine proximity** ("before God") — which is key to the judgment context.

---

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

- **1 Enoch 9:1–3** — the archangels report to YHWH that the earth is “filled with blood and injustice.”
    
- **Jubilees 5:2–3** — says the earth was “entirely corrupted… all flesh had corrupted its way.”
    
- **Matthew 24:37** — Yeshua parallels the days of Noaḥ with the **last days**, implying similar **conditions of widespread lawlessness and judgment**.
    

> This verse **sets the stage**: a world beyond redemption, crying out for cleansing.
