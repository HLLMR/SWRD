### **GENESIS 6:13**

_Scroll of Noaḥ_  
(Traditional Genesis 6:13)

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And Elohim said to Noaḥ, “The end of all flesh has come before Me, for the earth is filled with violence through them. And behold, I am about to destroy them with the earth.”**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וַיֹּאמֶר אֱלֹהִים לְנֹחַ  
קֵץ כָּל־בָּשָׂר בָּא לְפָנַי  
כִּי־מָלְאָה הָאָרֶץ חָמָס מִפְּנֵיהֶם  
וְהִנְנִי מַשְׁחִיתָם אֶת־הָאָרֶץ

---

#### Transliteration:

_Vayyomer Elohim le’Noaḥ,  
qetz kol-basar ba lefanai,  
ki male’ah ha’aretz ḥamas mipneihem,  
ve’hineni mashḥitam et-ha’aretz._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And God said to Noe, The end of all flesh is come before Me, because the earth is filled with iniquity by them; and behold, I destroy them and the earth.”

> The LXX echoes the MT word-for-word but uses **ἀνομία (anomia)** again for **ḥamas**, reinforcing the legal connotation of lawlessness.

---

#### DSS (4QGen):

DSS affirms this verse fully with no variant readings. The triple echo of corruption → violence → destruction is intact.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“The end of all flesh has come before Me…”**

- **קֵץ כָּל־בָּשָׂר (qetz kol-basar)** — not merely lifespan, but **destiny**, **finality**, **termination**.
    
- “Has come before Me” — a **judicial idiom**, signaling that YHWH has convened His heavenly court. The time for mercy has ended.
    

> This is the **divine verdict**, following exhaustive witness of human and hybrid corruption.

---

**“For the earth is filled with violence through them”**

- “Through them” (מִפְּנֵיהֶם) — refers to **the agents of corruption**: both human and Nephilim.
    
- Again, **ḥamas** implies a systemic culture of **oppression, exploitation, and brutality** — likely enforced by the hybrid tyrants of Genesis 6:4.
    

> This is not incidental sin — it is a **planetary regime of rebellion**.

---

**“Behold, I am about to destroy them with the earth”**

- **מַשְׁחִיתָם (mashḥitam)** — same root as the earlier **shachat (שָׁחַת)** — to destroy, ruin, corrupt.
    
- YHWH will do to them what they did to creation — a **measured act of poetic justice**.
    
- “With the earth” (אֶת־הָאָרֶץ) — may imply:
    
    - The **medium** of judgment (earth itself as agent)
        
    - Or that **the planet itself will be purged**, swept clean by the waters of chaos.
        

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Some avoid linking “flesh” with Nephilim/angelic hybrids, reducing the verse to a general moral statement.
    
- But this **concludes a section** that began with divine-human transgression and climaxes in global corruption — this verse is the **judicial summation**.
    

> It is a **cosmic judgment**, not just a disciplinary action.

---

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**AM 1656 (exact year of the Flood)**

- This decree is delivered shortly before YHWH gives ark-building instructions — Noaḥ is **600 years old** (Genesis 7:6).
    
- This marks the **final divine word before preservation begins**.

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and behold, I will destroy them with the earth.”

**YLT:**  
“And God saith to Noah, ‘The end of all flesh hath come before Me, for the earth hath been filled [with] violence from their presence; and lo, I am destroying them with the earth.’”

**NIV:**  
“So God said to Noah, ‘I am going to put an end to all people, for the earth is filled with violence because of them. I am surely going to destroy both them and the earth.’”

> NIV replaces “flesh” with “people,” obscuring the broader Hebrew scope — which includes **all biological creatures** under judgment.

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

- **Isaiah 24:5–6** — “The earth is also defiled… therefore a curse devours the earth, and they that dwell therein are desolate.”
    
- **1 Enoch 10:9–10** — “Destroy all the children of the watchers… cleanse the earth from all unrighteousness.”
    
- **2 Peter 2:5** — “God did not spare the ancient world, but saved Noaḥ… bringing in the Flood upon the world of the ungodly.”
    

> This is the **divine sentence** — a full judicial declaration against a world beyond redemption.
