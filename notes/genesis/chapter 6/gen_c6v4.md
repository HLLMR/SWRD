### **GENESIS 6:4**

_Scroll of Noaḥ_  
(Traditional Genesis 6:4)

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**The Nephilim were in the earth in those days—and also after that—when the sons of Elohim came in to the daughters of men, and they bore children to them. Those were the mighty ones who were of old, men of the name.**

#### Hebrew (MT):

הַנְּפִלִים הָיוּ בָאָרֶץ בַּיָּמִים הָהֵם  
וְגַם אַחֲרֵי־כֵן  
אֲשֶׁר יָבֹאוּ בְנֵי־הָאֱלֹהִים  
אֶל־בְּנוֹת הָאָדָם  
וְיָלְדוּ לָהֶם  
הֵמָּה הַגִּבֹּרִים אֲשֶׁר מֵעוֹלָם  
אַנְשֵׁי הַשֵּׁם

#### Transliteration:

_Hannefilim hayu va’aretz bayamim hahem,  
vegam acharei-khen,  
asher yavo’u benei-haElohim el-benot ha’adam,  
veyaldu lahem —  
hemmah hagibborim asher me’olam,  
anshei hashem._

#### LXX (Brenton):

“Now the giants were upon the earth in those days, and after that, when the sons of God were coming in to the daughters of men, and they bore children to them—those were the giants of old, the men of renown.”

> LXX renders **Nephilim** as **γίγαντες (gigantes)**, reinforcing the link between these beings and **physical might, stature, and violence**.

---

#### DSS (1QapGen, 4QGen):

- The **Genesis Apocryphon** (1QapGen) expands this passage, identifying the Nephilim as **giant offspring** of watchers and women, some named explicitly (e.g., **Ohyah, Hahyah**).
    
- 4QGen confirms the **benei haElohim + human women = Nephilim** formula. No textual evidence supports allegorical reinterpretation.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“The Nephilim were in the earth in those days…”**

- **Nephilim (נְפִלִים)** derives from the root **נ-פ-ל (npl)** meaning “to fall” — often interpreted as **fallen ones**, **those who cause others to fall**, or **those fallen from heaven**.
    
- This is **not** synonymous with “giants” (though some were giant); the Nephilim are **a hybrid race**, product of divine-human transgression.
    

---

**“And also after that…”**

- This clause implies that the Nephilim **persisted beyond the initial incursion**, potentially post-Flood (cf. Numbers 13:33).
    

> Some watchers’ offspring may have survived through later incursions, or their genetic legacy continued via illicit unions even after judgment.

---

**“When the sons of Elohim came in to the daughters of men…”**

- This again affirms that the Nephilim arose from **physical union between heavenly beings and human women** — not allegory.
    

---

**“Those were the mighty ones who were of old, men of the name.”**

- **gibborim (גִּבֹּרִים)** — usually means “mighty men,” but in this context, refers to beings of **great strength, violence, and possibly kingship or tyranny**.
    
- **anshei hashem (אַנְשֵׁי הַשֵּׁם)** — literally, “men of the name,” traditionally rendered “men of renown.”
    

> This may hint at **self-deified rulers**, establishing **proto-Nimrodian cults** or becoming **legendary in corruption**.

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- The **Nephilim have been sanitized** in many translations and commentaries — obscuring the original context of **angelic-human hybridization** and pre-Flood judgment.
    
- Attempts to translate “Nephilim” as simply “tyrants” or “heroes” collapse under the unified testimony of **Enoch, Jubilees, LXX, DSS, and Peter/Jude**.
    

> The pre-Flood world was **not merely sinful** — it was **genetically and spiritually corrupted** beyond repair.

---

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Between AM 1536–1650**

- The Nephilim likely appeared **shortly after the 120-year warning** (v. 3), and their dominance escalated until the Flood.
    

> Their presence defines the **final generation** before the deluge — the apex of antediluvian apostasy.

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them—the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown.”

**YLT:**  
“The fallen ones were in the earth in those days, and even afterwards, when sons of God come in unto daughters of men, and they have borne to them—they are the heroes, who, from of old, are the men of name.”

**NIV:**  
“The Nephilim were on the earth in those days—and also afterward—when the sons of God went to the daughters of humans and had children by them. They were the heroes of old, men of renown.”

> KJV preserves “giants,” YLT and NIV adopt transliteration “Nephilim” but maintain ambiguity. Only YLT captures the nuance of “fallen ones.”

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

- **1 Enoch 7–10** — gives detailed descriptions of the watchers’ children: giants 3000 cubits tall who “devoured all the labor of men.”
    
- **Jubilees 5:1–3** — declares this corruption as the final cause of judgment.
    
- **Numbers 13:33** — reports Nephilim post-Flood in Canaan, suggesting **either renewed incursion or inherited bloodlines**.
    
- **2 Peter 2:4 & Jude 1:6** — confirm that certain angels sinned by leaving their estate, paralleling this rebellion.
    

> This verse completes the picture: **illicit unions → hybrid offspring → violent dominion → divine judgment**.
