### **GENESIS 6:10**

_Scroll of Noaḥ_  
(Traditional Genesis 6:10)

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And Noaḥ fathered three sons: Shem, Ḥam, and Yapheth.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וַיּוֹלֶד נֹחַ  
שְׁלֹשָׁה בָנִים  
אֶת־שֵׁם אֶת־חָם וְאֶת־יָפֶת

---

#### Transliteration:

_Vayyoleid Noaḥ  
sheloshah vanim —  
et-Shem, et-Ḥam, ve’et-Yapheth._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And Noe begot three sons: Sem, Cham, and Japheth.”

> The LXX matches MT exactly in structure, though the **name order varies elsewhere**, reflecting theological—not chronological—priority.

---

#### DSS (4QGen):

Consistent with MT. The triplet format is preserved without deviation. The names match those found in Genesis 5:32.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“And Noaḥ fathered three sons…”**

- This is a **summary verse**, echoing Genesis 5:32, but now positioned at the **end of the Scroll of Noaḥ’s character profile** (vv. 8–10).
    
- This signals the transition from **righteous man** to **preserver of the remnant** — the chosen vessel through which the **nations will be reborn**.
    

---

**“Shem, Ḥam, and Yapheth”**

- The order here is **covenantal, not chronological**:
    
    - **Yapheth** is the eldest (cf. Genesis 10:21).
        
    - **Shem** is the spiritual heir (ancestor of Avraham, Israel, and Messiah).
        
    - **Ḥam** is the youngest and becomes the father of **Canaan**, which bears later judgment (Genesis 9:24–25).
        
- The structure affirms that while **YHWH preserves a biological remnant**, He also lays groundwork for **covenantal election**.
    

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Many commentators assume the order implies birth order — but the rest of Genesis clearly refutes this.
    

> This verse **establishes family structure**, not chronology — a pattern repeated in Isaac over Ishmael, Jacob over Esau, and David over his brothers.

---

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Between AM 1556–1650**

- Genesis 5:32 tells us Noaḥ was 500 when his sons began to be born.
    
- By Genesis 6:10, they are old enough to **be named and preserved** — likely in their 40s–90s by the time of the Flood.

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And Noah begat three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.”

**YLT:**  
“And Noah begetteth three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.”

**NIV:**  
“Noah had three sons: Shem, Ham and Japheth.”

> All translations agree closely. NIV simplifies “begat” to “had,” maintaining clarity but losing genealogical tone.

---

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

- **Genesis 10:1–32** — the **Table of Nations** expands from these three.
    
- **Jubilees 7–10** — details the division of the earth among them.
    
- **1 Chronicles 1:4–5** — affirms them as patriarchs of the post-Flood world.
    

> These three names will **repopulate the earth**, with Shem carrying the **seed of promise**, Yapheth extending toward the isles, and Ḥam producing the line of Canaan.
