### **GENESIS 6:14**

_Scroll of Noaḥ_  
(Traditional Genesis 6:14)

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**Make for yourself an ark of gopher wood; rooms you shall make in the ark, and you shall cover it inside and outside with pitch.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

עֲשֵׂה לְךָ תֵּבַת עֲצֵי־גֹפֶר  
קִנִּים תַּעֲשֶׂה אֶת־הַתֵּבָה  
וְכָפַרְתָּ אֹתָה מִבַּיִת וּמִחוּץ בַּכֹּפֶר

---

#### Transliteration:

_ʿAseh lekha tevah ʿatzei-gofer;  
qinnim taʿaseh et-hatevah,  
vekhafarta otah mibayit u’mikhutz bakofer._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“Make therefore for thyself an ark of square timber; thou shalt make the ark in compartments, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.”

> LXX uses “square timber” (ξύλων τετραγώνων) for **gopher wood**, likely a guess — the Hebrew term **“gofer”** is otherwise unknown.

---

#### DSS (4QGen):

Consistent with MT. No variance on the use of **tevah (ark)** or structural commands — reinforcing the **exact nature** of the instructions.

---

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“Make for yourself an ark…”**

- **תֵּבָה (tevah)** — used only here and in Exodus 2 (Moses' basket) — denotes a **floating vessel**, not a ship with sails or oars.
    
- The command is personal: **“for yourself”** (לְךָ) — emphasizing Noaḥ's responsibility for the **preservation of life**.
    

---

**“Of gopher wood”**

- **עֲצֵי־גֹפֶר (ʿatzei-gofer)** — **unique word**, likely a type of **resinous wood**, possibly cypress or cedar.
    

> Some scholars suggest “gofer” may be a variant or ancient species now extinct or unidentifiable.

---

**“Rooms (qinnim) you shall make…”**

- **קִנִּים (qinnim)** — literally “nests” or **compartments**, suggesting **organized interior sections** for animals, supplies, and personnel.
    

---

**“Cover it inside and outside with pitch (kofer)”**

- **כָּפַר (kafar)** — same root as **atonement** (כִּפֻּרִים), meaning “to cover, to smear, to protect.”
    
- **כֹּפֶר (kofer)** — pitch or resin; waterproofing agent, likely tree-based (bitumen not native to this region).
    

> There is deep theological resonance here: the ark is **covered in pitch**, just as **sins are covered in atonement** — both offer **protection from judgment**.

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Many commentaries treat the ark as mythic or metaphorical, minimizing the technical detail here.
    

> But the text is explicit: **YHWH gave precise architectural plans** — suggesting real-world engineering for divine purposes.

- The **thematic overlap between the ark and the tabernacle** is often overlooked: both involve precise instructions, compartments, and divine presence/salvation.
    

---

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Shortly before AM 1656**

- This command marks the **official beginning of the preservation phase**.
    
- The ark will take **decades** to build and prepare, while Noaḥ continues **preaching righteousness** (cf. 2 Peter 2:5).

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.”

**YLT:**  
“Make for thyself an ark of gopher-wood; nests thou dost make with the ark, and hast covered it within and without with cypress.”

**NIV:**  
“So make yourself an ark of cypress wood; make rooms in it and coat it with pitch inside and out.”

> NIV assumes “gopher” = “cypress,” which is plausible but **not certain**. KJV and YLT stay truer to the Hebrew ambiguity.

---

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

- **Exodus 2:3** — Moses’ **tevah** is covered in **tar and pitch** and placed upon the waters — symbolically echoing this moment.
    
- **Hebrews 11:7** — Noaḥ, “being warned of things not yet seen, moved with godly fear, prepared an ark…”
    
- **1 Peter 3:20–21** — draws a typological line from **Noaḥ’s ark to baptism**, both as **instruments of deliverance through judgment**.
    

> This verse opens the engineering blueprint for **divine preservation** in a world destined for destruction.
