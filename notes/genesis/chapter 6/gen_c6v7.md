### **GENESIS 6:7**

_Scroll of Noaḥ_  
(Traditional Genesis 6:7)

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And YHWH said, “I will wipe man whom I have created from upon the face of the ground — from man to beast, to crawling thing, and to flying creature of the heavens — for I am grieved that I have made them.”**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וַיֹּאמֶר יְהוָה  
אֶמְחֶה אֶת־הָאָדָם אֲשֶׁר בָּרָאתִי  
מֵעַל פְּנֵי הָאֲדָמָה  
מֵאָדָם עַד־בְּהֵמָה  
עַד רֶמֶשׂ וְעַד עוֹף הַשָּׁמָיִם  
כִּי נִחַמְתִּי כִּי עֲשִׂיתִם

---

#### Transliteration:

_Vayomer YHWH,  
emḥeh et-ha’adam asher bara’ti  
me’al penei ha’adamah —  
me’adam ad-behemah,  
ad remes ve’ad of ha’shamayim —  
ki niḥamti ki asitim._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And the Lord God said, I will blot out man whom I have made from the face of the earth — from man to cattle, and from creeping things even to birds of the sky — for I am grieved that I made them.”

> The LXX preserves the full structure, with **emḥeh (I will wipe/blot out)** rendered as **ἐξαλείψω (exaleipsō)** — a term used for erasing names or records.

---

#### DSS (4QGen):

No substantial variations. The DSS upholds the same **divine decree of annihilation**, worded almost identically to the MT.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“I will wipe man… from upon the face of the ground”**

- **אֶמְחֶה (emḥeh)** — to blot out, erase, efface — used elsewhere for wiping names from records (e.g., Exodus 32:33).
    

> This is not just physical death; it is **covenantal erasure** — a **reset** of creation’s living record.

---

**“From man to beast, to creeping thing, and to flying creature…”**

- This reversal of the **Genesis 1 creation order** highlights the **complete unraveling** of what was once “very good.”
    
- The comprehensive listing echoes **Genesis 1:26–28** (dominion mandate) — now undone by sin and judgment.
    

---

**“For I am grieved that I have made them”**

- Repeats the sorrow from Genesis 6:6, but now in a **declarative and judicial context**.
    
- “Them” here includes **all terrestrial life**, not just humanity — a consequence of man’s federal headship and the contamination introduced through **angelic corruption**.
    

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Some modern readings separate this judgment from the **watchers and Nephilim context** — but the text explicitly builds from vv. 1–6.
    
- The total erasure is not an overreaction but a **measured response to cosmic defilement**.
    

> This is not just about bad behavior — it’s about **ontological corruption** requiring global cleansing.

---

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Circa AM 1650**

- This pronouncement likely occurs within the **final decade before the Flood (AM 1656)**.
    
- Noaḥ will soon be commanded to build the ark — signaling a path of preservation amid destruction.

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And the LORD said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them.”

**YLT:**  
“And Jehovah saith, ‘I wipe away man whom I have prepared from off the face of the ground — from man unto beast, unto creeping thing, and unto fowl of the heavens — for I have repented that I have made them.’”

**NIV:**  
“So the LORD said, ‘I will wipe from the face of the earth the human race I have created — and with them the animals, the birds and the creatures that move along the ground — for I regret that I have made them.’”

> KJV’s “destroy” is too vague; YLT and NIV correctly render **“wipe out”** — a term that suggests **complete purging**, not mere punishment.

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

- **Exodus 32:33** — “Whoever has sinned against Me, I will blot him out of My book.”
    
- **Revelation 3:5** — “I will not blot out his name from the Book of Life…”
    
- **1 Enoch 10:9–10** — declares that the earth will be cleansed of the giants and their offspring “from the face of the earth” — echoing the exact phrasing used here.
    

> This is the first appearance of the **decree of extinction** — but it is not the end of the story. A **remnant will be preserved**.
