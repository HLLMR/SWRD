### **GENESIS 6:3**

_Scroll of Noaḥ_  
(Traditional Genesis 6:3)

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And YHWH said, “My Spirit shall not strive with man forever—for he is indeed flesh; and his days shall be one hundred and twenty years.”**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וַיֹּאמֶר יְהוָה  
לֹא־יָדוֹן רוּחִי בָאָדָם לְעוֹלָם  
בְּשַׁגַּם הוּא בָשָׂר  
וְהָיוּ יָמָיו מֵאָה וְעֶשְׂרִים שָׁנָה

---

#### Transliteration:

_Vayomer YHWH,  
lo-yadon ruchi va’adam l’olam,  
beshagam hu basar,  
vehayu yamav me’ah ve’esrim shanah._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And the Lord God said, My Spirit shall certainly not remain among these men forever, because they are flesh; but their days shall be an hundred and twenty years.”

> The LXX substitutes “remain” (καταμεῖνεν) for “strive” — a shift in nuance, but preserves the **withdrawal of divine presence** and the **120-year limit**.

---

#### DSS (4QGen):

No significant variants preserved for this verse. The MT rendering is confirmed in structure and theology.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“My Spirit shall not strive with man forever”**

- The verb **יָדוֹן** (_yadon_) is rare — likely from a root meaning “to contend” or “govern.”
    
- The phrase reflects **divine patience reaching a limit**: Elohim will no longer tolerate mankind’s corruption.
    
- The use of **“Spirit” (רוּחִי)** evokes **Genesis 1:2** — the ruach that hovered over the waters now prepares to **withdraw**.
    

---

**“For he is indeed flesh”**

- **בְּשַׁגַּם הוּא בָשָׂר** (beshagam hu basar) — a difficult clause, sometimes rendered as “inasmuch as he is flesh.”
    
- Suggests that mankind’s **carnality**, susceptibility to corruption, and spiritual rebellion have rendered him incompatible with YHWH’s indwelling.
    
- Flesh here is not merely physicality, but **mortal weakness and moral failure**.
    

---

**“And his days shall be one hundred and twenty years”**

- Often misread as a new **lifespan limit**, but this is better understood as a **countdown to judgment**.
    

> From this point (circa **AM 1536**), a **120-year grace period** begins, culminating in the **Flood at AM 1656**.

- This timeline aligns with **1 Peter 3:20**, which describes Elohim “waiting patiently in the days of Noaḥ.”
    

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Many commentators wrongly interpret this as limiting **individual human lifespans**, but post-Flood figures like **Shem (600)** and **Avraham (175)** disprove this.
    

> The 120 years is not a biological cap — it’s a **judicial decree**: the **time left before destruction**.

- The ambiguity of “beshagam” has led to various translations; some even interpret it as a veiled reference to **Noaḥ** (“b’shegam” → “in whom also”).
    

---

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Circa AM 1536**

- The 120-year period begins as YHWH pronounces judgment.
    
- **Noaḥ’s sons are still young** or not yet born (cf. Genesis 5:32) — the ark-building will begin soon after this warning.

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And the LORD said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.”

**YLT:**  
“And Jehovah saith, ‘My Spirit doth not strive in man — to the age; in their erring he is flesh: and his days have been an hundred and twenty years.’”

**NIV:**  
“Then the LORD said, ‘My Spirit will not contend with humans forever, for they are mortal; their days will be a hundred and twenty years.’”

> The NIV again smooths the interpretation, translating the clause in line with **lifespan limitation**, rather than the more faithful **judgment clock** reading.

---

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

- **1 Peter 3:19–20** — affirms YHWH’s long-suffering patience “while the ark was being prepared.”
    
- **Jubilees 5:6** — equates this announcement with a divine decree of the Flood.
    
- **1 Enoch 10:11–12** — corresponds with YHWH’s order to bind Azazel and prepare for judgment.
    

> This is the **divine ultimatum**: Elohim’s ruach will no longer plead with flesh. The countdown begins.
