וַהֲקִמֹתִי אֶת־בְּרִיתִי אִתָּךְ  
וּבָאתָ אֶל־הַתֵּבָה  
אַתָּה וּבָנֶיךָ וְאִשְׁתְּךָ  
וּנְשֵׁי בָנֶיךָ אִתָּךְ

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“But I will establish My covenant with you”**

- **וַהֲקִמֹתִי אֶת־בְּרִיתִי (va’haqimoti et-beriti)** — “I will cause My covenant to stand” or “confirm My covenant.”
    

> This is the **first explicit use of the word “berit” (covenant)** in Scripture — a monumental theological moment.

- The covenant here is:
    
    - **Initiated by YHWH**
        
    - **Unilateral and gracious**
        
    - **Precedes obedience** (ark not yet built)
        
- This is not yet the **Noaḥide covenant of Genesis 9** — but its **prelude**, grounded in **preservation and promise**.
    

---

**“You shall enter the ark — you, your sons, your wife, and your sons’ wives with you”**

- YHWH reaffirms **family deliverance** — not just individual survival.
    
- Structure:
    
    - **You (Noaḥ)**
        
    - **Your sons**
        
    - **Your wife**
        
    - **Your sons’ wives**
        

> This affirms the principle of **fathers as covenantal heads**, but also highlights YHWH’s mercy extending to those connected to the righteous.

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Some modern critics treat the “covenant” here as symbolic or literary foreshadowing — but the Hebrew is **clear and formal**.
    

> This is not metaphor — it is the first divine **covenantal anchor point** post-Eden.

- Traditional theology sometimes treats Genesis 9 as the first covenant, but **Genesis 6:18** is the true inception of the **covenantal storyline**.

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Final year before AM 1656**

- Judgment is imminent. This covenant signals **YHWH’s commitment to preserve a righteous remnant**.

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee.”

**YLT:**  
“And I have established My covenant with thee, and thou hast come in unto the ark — thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons’ wives with thee.”

**NIV:**  
“But I will establish my covenant with you, and you will enter the ark — you and your sons and your wife and your sons’ wives with you.”

> All versions agree closely. KJV retains the formal tone. NIV smooths it slightly but preserves core meaning.

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

- **Genesis 9:9–17** — expands this covenant into a formal, post-Flood agreement with all living creatures and future generations.
    
- **Hebrews 11:7** — affirms that Noaḥ “became heir of the righteousness which is by faith,” implying covenant inheritance.
    
- **1 Peter 3:20–21** — shows this covenant as a type of **baptismal preservation** through water.
    

> Genesis 6:18 is the **grace clause** in a chapter dominated by judgment — a clear signal of **YHWH’s redemptive trajectory**.
