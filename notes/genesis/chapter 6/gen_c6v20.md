### **GENESIS 6:20**

_Scroll of Noaḥ_  
(Traditional Genesis 6:20)

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**Of the flying creature according to its kind, and of the beast according to its kind, of every creeping thing of the ground according to its kind — two of every kind shall come to you, to keep them alive.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

מֵהָעוֹף לְמִינֵהוּ  
וּמִן־הַבְּהֵמָה לְמִינָהּ  
מִכֹּל רֶמֶשׂ הָאֲדָמָה לְמִינֵהוּ  
שְׁנַיִם מִכֹּל יָבֹאוּ אֵלֶיךָ  
לְהַחֲיוֹת

---

#### Transliteration:

_Me’ha’of le’minehu,  
u’min-habehemah leminah,  
mikkol remes ha’adamah le’minehu —  
shnayim mikol yavo’u eilekha  
le’hachayot._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“Of flying creatures according to their kind, and of cattle according to their kind, and of every reptile creeping on the earth according to its kind — two of all shall come in to thee, male and female, to be preserved alive.”

> LXX follows MT but uses “reptile” for **רֶמֶשׂ (remes)** — a broad category including crawling land animals.

---

#### DSS (4QGen):

No variation from MT. The categories and “kind” distinctions are emphasized — mirroring Genesis 1.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“Of the flying creature… of the beast… of every creeping thing…”**

- Categories follow **creation taxonomy**:
    
    - **עוף (ʿof)** — flying things (birds, bats, flying insects)
        
    - **בהמה (behemah)** — domesticated or large land animals
        
    - **רֶמֶשׂ (remes)** — crawling things (reptiles, small land creatures)
        

> These match the **Day Five and Six** structures of Genesis 1 — framing the ark as a **mobile restoration of Edenic order**.

---

**“According to its kind (לְמִינֵהוּ / לְמִינָהּ)”**

- The phrase **“according to its kind”** appears **three times** in this verse, emphasizing the **preservation of genetic and ecological boundaries**.
    

> The corruption of “kinds” (cf. Genesis 6:12) is now being **countered through divine order**.

---

**“Two of every kind shall come to you…”**

- **יָבֹאוּ אֵלֶיךָ (yavo’u eilekha)** — “shall come to you”
    

> Noaḥ is not commanded to capture them — **YHWH sends them**.

- This passive construction reveals **divine orchestration** — consistent with later examples like:
    
    - **Exodus 16:13** — quail brought in by YHWH
        
    - **1 Kings 17:4** — ravens sent to feed Eliyahu
        

---

**“To keep them alive (לְהַחֲיוֹת)”**

- Repetition from v. 19 — reinforcing **life-preservation as covenantal purpose**.
    
- Noaḥ becomes a **mediator of survival**, a proto-priest preserving both man and beast for the **world to come**.
    

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Critics often misunderstand “kind” as species-level. But Hebrew **min** corresponds better to **genetic families or base kinds**, not micro-divisions of modern biology.
    

> This dramatically reduces the needed pair count and supports logistical plausibility.

---

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Within days of AM 1656**

- The movement has begun: the animals are now **divinely gathering** to Noaḥ for boarding.

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive.”

**YLT:**  
“Of the fowl after its kind, and of the cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the ground after its kind, two of every [sort] they come in unto thee to keep alive.”

**NIV:**  
“Two of every kind of bird, of every kind of animal and of every kind of creature that moves along the ground will come to you to be kept alive.”

> All agree on structure. NIV simplifies language, but maintains divine initiation (“will come to you”) and preservation.

---

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

- **Genesis 2:19–20** — YHWH brings the animals to Adam; here, He brings them to Noaḥ — **restating human stewardship over life**.
    
- **Isaiah 11:6–9** — prophesies a renewed world where animals dwell together in peace — **Noaḥ’s ark prefigures this harmony**.
    
- **Revelation 5:13** — “Every creature… on earth and under the earth and in the sea…” — points to an eventual **redemptive inclusion of all living creation**.
    

> This verse completes the biological logistics of the ark — a creation-born, covenant-backed plan to **replant life after judgment**.
