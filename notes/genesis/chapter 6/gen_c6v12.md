### **GENESIS 6:12**

_Scroll of Noaḥ_  
(Traditional Genesis 6:12)

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And Elohim looked upon the earth, and behold—it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted its way upon the earth.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וַיַּרְא אֱלֹהִים אֶת־הָאָרֶץ  
וְהִנֵּה נִשְׁחָתָה  
כִּי־הִשְׁחִית כָּל־בָּשָׂר  
אֶת־דַּרְכּוֹ עַל־הָאָרֶץ

---

#### Transliteration:

_Vayyar Elohim et-ha’aretz,  
ve’hinneh nishchatah —  
ki hishchit kol-basar et-darko al-ha’aretz._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And God looked upon the earth, and behold, it was corrupted; for all flesh had corrupted its way upon the earth.”

> LXX agrees fully with the MT — preserving the triple use of **shachat** (ש-ח-ת) as the dominant motif of this passage.

---

#### DSS (4QGen):

Matches MT without variation. The repetition of the corruption motif is emphasized — suggesting both **moral collapse and physical degeneration**.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“And Elohim looked upon the earth…”**

- Echoes **Genesis 1:31** — but where once God “saw all that He had made, and it was very good,” now He sees a creation **perverted by rebellion**.
    
- The **judicial gaze** of Elohim introduces divine accountability — this is no longer tolerable.
    

---

**“And behold—it was corrupt (נִשְׁחָתָה)”**

- Passive participle: **“had become ruined”** — not merely flawed but fundamentally defiled.
    
- Reaffirms the **ontological breakdown** of created order introduced by Nephilim and human sin.
    

---

**“For all flesh had corrupted its way…”**

- **כָּל־בָּשָׂר (kol-basar)** — all flesh; this includes **humans and animals**, especially in light of verses 7 and 13.
    

> Suggests a **planetary contamination** — both moral and genetic.

- **אֶת־דַּרְכּוֹ (et-darko)** — “its way” — implies that **natural behavior**, **instinct**, and **purpose** were inverted or violated.
    

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Many avoid the **biological implications** here, reading “flesh” only as metaphor for human moral failure.
    
- But early Hebrew interpreters, and **1 Enoch, Jubilees, and Genesis Apocryphon**, read this as literal — even the animals were defiled by **watcher transgression** and hybridization.
    

> This verse exposes a world in which **nothing remains untouched** — everything is fallen, and judgment is inevitable.

---

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Final approach to AM 1656**

- Noaḥ is now nearing 600 years old (Genesis 7:6), and YHWH is preparing His instructions for salvation and judgment.

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.”

**YLT:**  
“And God seeth the earth, and lo, it hath been corrupted, for all flesh hath corrupted its way on the earth.”

**NIV:**  
“God saw how corrupt the earth had become, for all the people on earth had corrupted their ways.”

> The NIV narrows **“all flesh”** to **“people”**, but this flattens the original — **animals are included** in the Hebrew phrasing and flood consequences.

---

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

- **1 Enoch 7:5–6** — describes how the giants “sinned against birds and beasts and reptiles and fish.”
    
- **Jubilees 5:2** — “And all flesh corrupted its way… men and cattle and beasts and birds and everything that walks on the earth.”
    
- **Romans 8:22** — “All creation groans…” — a post-Fall echo of this same **universal fracture**.
    

> This verse signals not just guilt, but **defilement** — a total systemic breakdown of life as YHWH created it.
