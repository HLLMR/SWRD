### **GENESIS 6:16**

_Scroll of Noaḥ_  
(Traditional Genesis 6:16)

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**A window you shall make for the ark, and to a cubit you shall finish it from above; and the door of the ark you shall set in its side; with lower, second, and third stories you shall make it.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

צֹהַר תַּעֲשֶׂה לַתֵּבָה  
וְאֶל־אַמָּה תְּכַלֶּנָּה מִלְּמַעְלָה  
וְפֶתַח הַתֵּבָה בְּצִדָּהּ תָּשִׂים  
תַּחְתִּיִּים שְׁנִיִים וּשְׁלִשִׁים תַּעֲשֶׂהָ

---

#### Transliteration:

_Tzohar taʿaseh latevah,  
ve’el-ammah tekhallenah milmaʿlah;  
ufetach hatevah be’tzidah tasim,  
taḥtiyim, sheniyim, u’shelishim taʿasehah._

#### LXX (Brenton):

“Thou shalt make the ark with a window of a cubit in breadth thou shalt finish it above, and the door of the ark thou shalt make on the side; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it.”

> The LXX mirrors the Hebrew dimensions and layout structure. “Tzohar” is translated simply as “window,” though its meaning may be more layered.

---

#### DSS (4QGen):

No variant in this verse. The architectural details are preserved as in MT — confirming the **tripartite structure** and single entrance.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“Tzohar (צֹהַר) you shall make…”**

- **Tzohar** can mean:
    
    - **Window** (light-admitting opening)
        
    - Or possibly a **radiant stone or skylight** (cf. Jewish midrash and later rabbinic tradition)
        

> The root צהר conveys **brightness, midday light** — implying this was the **only natural light source** in a sealed vessel.

---

**“To a cubit you shall finish it from above”**

- Likely describes the **window/skylight height**, or perhaps a **ventilation strip** just beneath the roofline, running around the top.
    
- A 1-cubit crown (18-inch clearance) may have spanned the top for **light and airflow**.
    

> This detail suggests careful **engineering for survivability** during extended seclusion.

---

**“The door you shall set in its side…”**

- Singular door = **one point of entry**, affirming YHWH’s **exclusive access point** to salvation.
    

> Later echoed in John 10:9 — “I am the door; if anyone enters through Me…”

---

**“With lower, second, and third stories…”**

- The ark was **three-tiered** — signifying:
    
    - **Compartmentalization** for animals, food, and human dwelling
        
    - Possibly even **symbolic structure** (earth/heaven/midheaven)
        

> The structure is **spatially ordered** for **sustainability, separation, and sanctity** — just like the later **Tabernacle and Temple**.

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Some scholars over-literalize or hyper-mystify “tzohar,” ignoring that both meanings (window or light-source) fit the context — this was a **functional and symbolic structure**.
    

> The ark was **both real and typological** — housing life while pointing toward **YHWH’s deliverance patterns**.

---

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Final phase before AM 1656**

- The ark’s structural plans are now complete. The next verse (6:17) will announce the **coming waters** and launch the logistics of preservation.

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it.”

**YLT:**  
“A window dost thou make for the ark, and unto a cubit thou dost finish it above; and the opening of the ark in its side thou dost put; lower, second, and third stories thou dost make it.”

**NIV:**  
“Make a roof for it, leaving below the roof an opening one cubit high all around. Put a door in the side of the ark and make lower, middle and upper decks.”

> The **NIV interprets tzohar** as a **roof-opening** — a plausible, but less literal translation. KJV/YLT maintain greater fidelity to the Hebrew structure.

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

- **Exodus 26** — Tabernacle design includes **multiple levels, central access, and precise measurements** — similar in function to the ark.
    
- **John 14:2** — “In My Father’s house are many rooms…” — echoes the **multi-level, divinely prepared dwelling** for preservation.
    
- **Revelation 4:1** — a single **open door in heaven** — may symbolically echo the ark’s one access point.
    

> This verse finalizes the **design blueprint** — not just for Noaḥ’s survival, but for YHWH’s **template of deliverance**.
