### **GENESIS 6:8**

_Scroll of Noaḥ_  
(Traditional Genesis 6:8)

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**But Noaḥ found favor in the eyes of YHWH.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וְנֹחַ מָצָא חֵן  
בְּעֵינֵי יְהוָה

---

#### Transliteration:

_Ve’Noaḥ matza ḥen  
be’einei YHWH._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“But Noe found grace before the Lord God.”

> LXX translates **“ḥen”** (grace/favor) as **χάριν (charin)** — underscoring divine **favor apart from merit**, consistent with NT usage.

---

#### DSS (4QGen):

Confirmed identical to MT — Noaḥ alone is marked out as the recipient of divine favor amidst universal judgment.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“But Noaḥ…”**

- The **conjunction וְ (ve)** marks a decisive **contrast** with the destruction just decreed.
    
- The Hebrew syntax places Noaḥ first for emphasis: **“But Noaḥ…”** — he is the pivot on which the fate of mankind now turns.
    

---

**“Found favor (ḥen) in the eyes of YHWH”**

- **ḥen (חֵן)** is divine **grace** — not earned by works but granted by sovereign choice.
    

> This is the **first explicit mention of grace in Scripture** — foundational to biblical soteriology.

- To find favor “in the eyes of YHWH” implies an **intimate, relational acknowledgment** — a personal connection amidst global estrangement.
    

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Some modern critics suggest Noaḥ earned favor through righteousness — but verse 9 follows this grace, not precedes it.
    

> Noaḥ’s righteousness is a **fruit of favor**, not its cause.

- The Hebrew sequencing affirms that **grace precedes obedience**, aligning with Paul’s argument in Romans and Hebrews.

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Circa AM 1650**

- With the Flood less than a decade away, this verse reveals the **preserved remnant** through whom YHWH will restart humanity.

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“But Noah found grace in the eyes of the LORD.”

**YLT:**  
“And Noah found grace in the eyes of Jehovah.”

**NIV:**  
“But Noah found favor in the eyes of the LORD.”

> All major translations agree closely. KJV and YLT retain “grace,” NIV softens to “favor” but maintains the core meaning.

---

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

- **Genesis 19:19** — Lot also “found favor” and was rescued from judgment.
    
- **Exodus 33:17** — Moses finds favor and is granted intimacy with YHWH.
    
- **Ephesians 2:8** — “For by grace are ye saved through faith…”
    

> This moment marks the **inauguration of the remnant theology** — where judgment falls, but grace preserves a seed.
