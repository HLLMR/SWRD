### **GENESIS 6:5**

_Scroll of Noaḥ_  
(Traditional Genesis 6:5)

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And YHWH saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and every inclination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וַיַּרְא יְהוָה  
כִּי רַבָּה רָעַת הָאָדָם בָּאָרֶץ  
וְכָל־יֵצֶר מַחְשְׁבוֹת לִבּוֹ  
רַק רַע כָּל־הַיּוֹם

---

#### Transliteration:

_Vayyar YHWH  
ki rabbah ra’at ha’adam ba’aretz,  
ve’khol yetzer machshevot libbo  
raq ra kol-hayyom._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And God saw that the wickedness of men was multiplied on the earth, and every one in his heart was intently thinking upon evil continually.”

> LXX intensifies the sense of **inward corruption** — “intently thinking” (διελογίζετο) adds deliberation to man’s evil.

---

#### DSS (4QGen):

Aligns precisely with the MT. No significant deviations. The scroll emphasizes **total moral collapse**.

---

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“And YHWH saw…”**

- Echoes Genesis 1:31 — but where once “Elohim saw that it was very good,” now YHWH sees that it is **only evil**.
    

> This is a **judgment reversal** of the creation blessing — the **Creator grieves over His creation.**

---

**“That the wickedness of man was great in the earth”**

- **רַבָּה רָעַת (rabbah ra’at)** — “great was the evil” — an intensifier, not just of quantity but **depth**.
    
- This echoes language of **Babylonian flood epics** (e.g. Atrahasis), but the Hebrew account attributes the evil not to divine whim but to **human and hybrid rebellion**.
    

---

**“Every inclination of the thoughts of his heart…”**

- **יֵצֶר (yetzer)** — the shaping or framing of thought; the **formative drives** of the inner person.
    
- **מַחְשְׁבוֹת לִבּוֹ** — "thoughts of his heart" — reveals that sin is not surface-level but **fundamental to man’s interior life**.
    

---

**“Only evil continually”**

- The Hebrew is emphatic:
    
    - **רַק (raq)** — only
        
    - **רַע (ra)** — evil
        
    - **כָּל־הַיּוֹם (kol-hayyom)** — all day, without interruption.
        

> There is no neutral thought, no break from corruption. The **imagination is hijacked** by darkness.

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Some modern theology softens the reading by treating “inclination” as potential or metaphorical — but the grammar asserts **total depravity**.
    
- This verse is foundational for **original sin** theology and **divine justice** — though many commentaries downplay its connection to the Nephilim context.
    

> Yet the text is clear: **the Nephilim incursion has utterly poisoned the heart of humanity**.

---

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Circa AM 1600–1650**

- Likely within **a generation of the Flood** (AM 1656).
    
- The population has grown, the Nephilim dominate, and **the moral landscape is ruined**.

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And GOD saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.”

**YLT:**  
“And Jehovah seeth that abundant is the wickedness of man in the earth, and every imagination of the thoughts of his heart is only evil every day.”

**NIV:**  
“The LORD saw how great the wickedness of the human race had become on the earth, and that every inclination of the thoughts of the human heart was only evil all the time.”

> NIV loses poetic weight with “only evil all the time.” YLT preserves the continuous sense. KJV’s “imagination” holds both creative and moral meaning.

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

- **Jeremiah 17:9** — “The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked.”
    
- **Romans 1:21** — echoes the futility and darkening of the mind.
    
- **1 Enoch 8:2** — describes how the watchers taught mankind sorcery, warcraft, and seduction — leading to this inner corruption.
    

> This verse represents **the tipping point**: when man, fallen in heart and multiplied in sin, becomes irredeemable apart from judgment.
