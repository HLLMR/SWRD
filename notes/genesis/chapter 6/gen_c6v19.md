### **GENESIS 6:19**

_Scroll of Noaḥ_  
(Traditional Genesis 6:19)

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And of every living thing, of all flesh, two of every kind you shall bring into the ark to keep them alive with you; they shall be male and female.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וּמִכָּל הַחַי  
מִכָּל בָּשָׂר  
שְׁנַיִם מִכֹּל תָּבִיא אֶל־הַתֵּבָה  
לְהַחֲיוֹת אִתָּךְ  
זָכָר וּנְקֵבָה יִהְיוּ

---

#### Transliteration:

_U’mikkol hachai,  
mikkol basar —  
shnayim mikol tavi el-hatevah  
le’hachayot itakh,  
zakhar u’neqevah yihyu._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And of all the cattle and of all flesh thou shalt bring into the ark two of all, that they may be kept alive with thee: they shall be male and female.”

> LXX closely mirrors the MT, using “ζῴων” (living creatures) and preserving the male/female distinction essential for **post-Flood reproduction**.

---

#### DSS (4QGen):

Fully aligns with MT — no variant readings. The preservation imperative is reiterated with **biological precision**.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“Of every living thing… of all flesh…”**

- Reinforces the **biological scope** of the rescue: animals, birds, creeping things (cf. vv. 20–21), not just humans.
    
- **כָּל בָּשָׂר (kol basar)** — “all flesh” — mirrors the judgment target in v. 17.
    

> YHWH preserves a **remnant of that which was sentenced**, distinguishing **types within kinds**.

---

**“Two of every kind you shall bring…”**

- **שְׁנַיִם מִכֹּל (shnayim mikol)** — not two of every species in modern taxonomy, but **two of every “kind”** (min).
    

> “Kind” is a broader Hebrew category — implying genetically distinct, reproductive groupings, but not necessarily Linnaean species.

- These pairs represent **the seed of biological continuity** post-Flood.
    

---

**“To keep them alive with you”**

- Noaḥ is not only a recipient of salvation — he becomes a **guardian of life**.
    
- **לְהַחֲיוֹת אִתָּךְ (le’hachayot itakh)** — “to preserve life with you” — a priestly function of **stewardship and preservation**.
    

---

**“Male and female they shall be”**

- Essential for **reproductive propagation**.
    
- This echoes **Genesis 1:27–28**, establishing the ark as a **portable Eden**, preparing for a **post-judgment creation reboot**.
    

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Critics often mock the logistics (“How could they fit all those animals?”), but the Hebrew concept of **“kind”** drastically narrows the number — likely **a few thousand pairs**, not millions.
    

> This was a **supernaturally guided, but physically viable operation**.

- Others overlook the theological point: **YHWH values and preserves non-human life**, not just mankind.

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Final days or weeks before AM 1656**

- These are operational instructions — the ark is likely complete or nearly so, and loading is imminent.

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female.”

**YLT:**  
“And of all that liveth, of all flesh, two of every [kind] thou dost bring into the ark, to keep alive with thee; male and female they are.”

**NIV:**  
“You are to bring into the ark two of all living creatures, male and female, to keep them alive with you.”

> All versions remain close. NIV simplifies structure, but maintains the **essence of preservation and pairing**.

---

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

- **Genesis 7:2–3** — expands this with **seven pairs** of clean animals, distinguishing **ritual from reproductive purpose**.
    
- **Leviticus 11** — later systematizes animal “kinds,” providing context for distinctions already known to Noaḥ.
    
- **Romans 8:21–22** — all creation groans for redemption — here, we see **creation being preserved**, not destroyed in total.
    

> Genesis 6:19 introduces the **creational covenant component** of the ark — not just human survival, but **biological continuity**.
