### **GENESIS 6:1**

_Scroll of Noaḥ_  
(Traditional Genesis 6:1)

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And it came to pass, when mankind began to multiply upon the face of the earth, and daughters were born to them—**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וַיְהִי כִּי־הֵחֵל הָאָדָם לָרֹב עַל־פְּנֵי הָאֲדָמָה  
וּבָנוֹת יֻלְּדוּ לָהֶם

---

#### Transliteration:

_Vayehi ki-heḥel ha’adam larov al-penei ha’adamah,  
u’vanot yull’du lahem._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And it came to pass when men began to be numerous upon the earth, and daughters were born to them—”

> The LXX closely matches the MT, but uses **ἀνθρώπων** (anthrōpōn, generic “humans”) instead of **ha’adam** (“the man” or “mankind”) — a minor but potentially meaningful nuance.

---

#### DSS (4QGen):

Preserved fragment matches the MT text with no significant deviation. Vocabulary and structure affirm “mankind” as a collective, not a specific lineage.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“When mankind began to multiply…”**

- This phrase marks a **narrative escalation**: from genealogical listing to societal description. We now witness the **conditions that preceded the Flood**.
    
- The verb **הֵחֵל** (_heḥel_) implies a notable _beginning_ — a shift or onset of an era of significant human expansion.
    
- **“Upon the face of the earth”** underscores widespread habitation, foreshadowing the global scope of coming judgment.

**“And daughters were born to them”**

- This clause introduces the **catalyst for the angelic-human transgression** that follows in Genesis 6:2.
    
- Daughters are not merely incidental — they are focal to the **Nephilim incursion** and the corruption of all flesh.
    

> The narrative lens is narrowing in on a specific class of beings—**the daughters of men**—as part of a cosmic drama.

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Traditional commentaries often **gloss over the transition** from genealogy to spiritual warfare, but this verse opens the **pre-Flood apocalypse narrative**.
    
- Some modern interpreters allegorize the coming events, obscuring the **supernatural elements** present in the early Hebrew worldview.
    

> But all ancient traditions — **MT, DSS, LXX, Enoch, Jubilees** — read Genesis 6 as a **radical incursion** event.

---

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Circa AM 1550–1556**

- This takes place shortly after the birth of Noaḥ’s sons (cf. Genesis 5:32), but before their adulthood.
    
- It precedes the Nephilim corruption (Genesis 6:2–4), which unfolds across the **century leading up to the Flood** (AM 1656).

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them—”

**YLT:**  
“And it cometh to pass that mankind have begun to multiply on the face of the ground, and daughters have been born to them—”

**NIV:**  
“When human beings began to increase in number on the earth and daughters were born to them—”

> All preserve the basic structure. YLT preserves the tense nuance; NIV generalizes “mankind” into “human beings” but remains textually aligned.

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

- **Genesis 6:2–4** — directly expands this setup into divine-human transgression.
    
- **1 Enoch 6–7** — elaborates on the sons of God, their descent to Mount Hermon, and their sin with human women.
    
- **Jubilees 5:1–2** — attributes the coming judgment to “the impurity of the watchers.”
    

> This verse is the **calm before the cosmic storm** — a subtle but vital bridge from history to mythic tragedy.
