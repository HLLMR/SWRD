### **GENESIS 6:2**

_Scroll of Noaḥ_  
(Traditional Genesis 6:2)

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**that the sons of Elohim saw the daughters of men, that they were goodly; and they took for themselves wives from all whom they chose.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וַיִּרְאוּ בְנֵי־הָאֱלֹהִים אֶת־בְּנוֹת הָאָדָם כִּי טֹבֹת הֵנָּה  
וַיִּקְחוּ לָהֶם נָשִׁים מִכֹּל אֲשֶׁר בָּחָרוּ

---

#### Transliteration:

_Vayyir’u benei-haElohim et-benot ha’adam ki tovot henah,  
vayyikḥu lahem nashim mikol asher bacharu._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“The sons of God, having seen the daughters of men that they were beautiful, took to themselves wives of all whom they chose.”

> The LXX retains the supernatural reading — **“sons of God” (οἱ υἱοὶ τοῦ Θεοῦ)** — confirming ancient agreement with the MT on the divine identity of the beings involved.

---

#### DSS (4QGen, 1QapGen):

- Fragmentary DSS texts confirm the **"benei haElohim"** reading.
    
- **1QapGen (Genesis Apocryphon)** explicitly names these sons of God as **watchers**, reinforcing Enoch’s account of **angelic descent** and corruption.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“Sons of Elohim” (בְּנֵי־הָאֱלֹהִים)**

- This term **always denotes divine or heavenly beings** in early Hebrew literature (cf. Job 1:6, 2:1, 38:7; Psalm 29:1, 89:6).
    
- Later Jewish and Christian interpreters (post-2nd century CE) began to **allegorize** this as referring to the **line of Seth**, but that view **lacks textual and historical support**.
    
- Ancient readers, including the authors of **1 Enoch, Jubilees, and the NT**, understood this as a **literal incursion of celestial beings**.
    

---

**“Saw the daughters of men, that they were goodly”**

- Echoes the language of Genesis 3:6 — “saw… that it was good” — suggesting a **recapitulation of Edenic desire and defiance**.
    
- The attraction is visual and sensual, driven by **aesthetic judgment**, not covenant or obedience.
    

---

**“And they took for themselves wives…”**

- This phrase (**וַיִּקְחוּ לָהֶם נָשִׁים**) implies **forceful acquisition**, not mutual covenant.
    
- Hebrew **laqach** ("took") can denote **marriage**, but here it likely signals **unauthorized union**, especially given the divine-human boundary being transgressed.
    
- The plural **“from all whom they chose”** reveals an **unrestrained and self-willed selection**, signaling corruption of the created order.
    

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- The **“Sethite” theory** is a post-biblical innovation, designed to sanitize the troubling implications of **angelic cohabitation**.
    
- Early church fathers like **Justin Martyr, Irenaeus, Tertullian, and Origen** all accepted the **angelic interpretation** — consistent with **Second Temple Judaism**.
    

> The attempt to suppress the supernatural view corresponds with rising discomfort over demonology and cosmology in later doctrine.

---

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Shortly after AM 1550**

- As human population expands, the **watchers** descend and begin their unions.
    
- This period marks the **start of the corruption** that will culminate in the judgment of the Flood in AM 1656.

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.”

**YLT:**  
“and sons of God see the daughters of men that they are fair, and they take to themselves women of all whom they have chosen.”

**NIV:**  
“the sons of God saw that the daughters of humans were beautiful, and they married any of them they chose.”

> The NIV introduces interpretive softness: “daughters of humans” flattens the cosmic tension, and “married” downplays the violent or unauthorized overtones of _laqach_.

---

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

- **1 Enoch 6–7** — gives names and oaths of the watchers, led by **Semjaza**, who descended to **Mount Hermon** and swore to defile mankind.
    
- **Jubilees 5:1–2** — explicitly states these unions brought about “all manner of wickedness and oppression.”
    
- **2 Peter 2:4** and **Jude 1:6** — reference these angels who “left their first estate” and were imprisoned in chains for their sin.
    

> This is the origin point of the **Nephilim**, **giants**, and global wickedness that provokes the Flood — a celestial rebellion against divine order through carnal union.
