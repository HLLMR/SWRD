### **GENESIS 6:17**

_Scroll of Noaḥ_  
(Traditional Genesis 6:17)

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And behold, I — even I — am bringing the floodwaters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh in which is the breath of life from under the heavens; everything that is in the earth shall perish.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וַאֲנִי הִנְנִי מֵבִיא  
אֶת־הַמַּבּוּל מַיִם עַל־הָאָרֶץ  
לְשַׁחֵת כָּל־בָּשָׂר אֲשֶׁר־בּוֹ רוּחַ חַיִּים  
מִתַּחַת הַשָּׁמָיִם  
כֹּל אֲשֶׁר־בָּאָרֶץ יִגְוָע

---

#### Transliteration:

_Va’ani hineni mevi  
et-hammabbul mayim al-ha’aretz  
leshacheit kol-basar asher-bo ruach ḥayyim  
mitachat hashamayim —  
kol asher va’aretz yigvaʿ._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And behold, I bring a flood of water upon the earth, to destroy all flesh in which is the breath of life, from under heaven; and all that is upon the earth shall die.”

> LXX faithfully echoes MT. The phrase **“breath of life”** emphasizes not just biological animation but **divinely granted vitality** (cf. Gen 2:7).

---

#### DSS (4QGen):

DSS is consistent with MT — reinforcing both the **poetic force** and **covenantal gravity** of this pronouncement.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“And behold, I — even I — am bringing…”**

- The construction **“va’ani hineni”** is emphatic: **“I, yes I Myself…”**
    

> This underscores that the judgment is **not natural**, not accidental — but a **direct act of Elohim**.

---

**“The Flood (mabbul) of waters…”**

- **מַבּוּל (mabbul)** — unique term used only for **Noaḥ’s Flood** (except Psalm 29:10).
    
- Not just a rainstorm — this word suggests a **cataclysm**, an **uncreation event** that resets the earth.
    

> It recalls the **chaotic waters** of Genesis 1:2, now returning in judgment.

---

**“To destroy all flesh in which is the breath of life”**

- **רוּחַ חַיִּים (ruach ḥayyim)** — same phrase used in Genesis 2:7 for man’s divine animation.
    
- “All flesh” includes animals and humans alike — this is **total biological reset**, excluding only what is preserved in the ark.
    

---

**“From under the heavens… all that is in the earth shall perish”**

- This is a **global judgment** — the scope is cosmic: everything under **the firmament (shamayim)** is subject to the decree.
    
- **יִגְוָע (yigvaʿ)** — “shall expire,” “breathe its last,” often used for **soul-departure** — a total cessation of life.
    

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Some argue for a **localized flood**, but this verse (along with Genesis 7) uses **universal language** repeatedly.
    

> “All flesh… under the heavens… all that is in the earth” leaves **no textual room for regional catastrophe theory**.

- Additionally, references in **2 Peter 3** and **Yeshua’s own words (Matt 24:38–39)** affirm a global, typological flood.
    

---

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**AM 1656**

- This is the **formal declaration of the Flood**, coming just before Noaḥ is instructed to gather life into the ark.
    
- The end is no longer a warning — it is imminent.

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven; and every thing that is in the earth shall die.”

**YLT:**  
“And I — lo, I am bringing in the deluge of waters on the earth to destroy all flesh, in which is a living spirit, from under the heavens; all that is in the earth doth expire.”

**NIV:**  
“I am going to bring floodwaters on the earth to destroy all life under the heavens that has the breath of life in it. Everything on earth will perish.”

> The **NIV paraphrases** slightly, smoothing “breath of life” and omitting the emphatic “I, even I.” KJV/YLT preserve the gravity and scale of the Hebrew.

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

- **Genesis 7:21–23** — confirms this with detailed enumeration: “all flesh died… all in whose nostrils was the breath of life.”
    
- **Psalm 104:29** — “You take away their breath, they expire…”
    
- **1 Enoch 10:2–3** — predicts this flood as a divine sentence against watchers and their seed.
    

> This verse marks the **point of no return** — the **divine decision to unmake what He once made**, with a single preserved remnant.
