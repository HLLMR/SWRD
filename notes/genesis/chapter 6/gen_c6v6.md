### **GENESIS 6:6**

_Scroll of Noaḥ_  
(Traditional Genesis 6:6)

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And YHWH was grieved that He had made man on the earth, and it pained Him to His heart.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וַיִּנָּחֶם יְהוָה כִּי עָשָׂה אֶת־הָאָדָם בָּאָרֶץ  
וַיִּתְעַצֵּב אֶל־לִבּוֹ

---

#### Transliteration:

_Vayinnaḥem YHWH ki asah et-ha’adam ba’aretz,  
vayit’atzzev el-libbo._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And God laid it to heart that He had made man upon the earth, and He pondered deeply.”

> The LXX softens the emotional tone — rendering “grieved” as “laid it to heart,” and “pained” as “pondered.” This reflects a **Greek discomfort with divine emotion**.

---

#### DSS (4QGen):

Aligns with the MT; preserves the emotional intensity of YHWH’s **grief and inner turmoil**.

---

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“YHWH was grieved…” (וַיִּנָּחֶם)**

- **נָחַם (nacham)** means to **lament**, **regret**, or **be moved to sorrow** — a deep inner turning.
    
- This is **not a change of mind** in the human sense, but a divine **mourning** over what man has become.
    

> The same root appears later in **Genesis 6:7** — reinforcing that this grief leads to judgment.

---

**“That He had made man on the earth”**

- The contrast with Genesis 1:31 (“Elohim saw everything… and behold, it was very good”) could not be more stark.
    
- This is **creation’s undoing** — not by flaw in design, but by willful corruption of both **man and angelic beings**.
    

---

**“And it pained Him to His heart” (וַיִּתְעַצֵּב אֶל־לִבּוֹ)**

- **עָצַב (atzav)** carries deep emotional weight — to be **pierced**, **wounded**, or **distressed**.
    
- **לִבּוֹ (libbo)** — literally “His heart” — signals that YHWH is not a detached judge, but a **relational Creator**, grieving over the ruin of His image-bearers.
    

> This verse reveals one of the most **intimate glimpses into the divine emotional life** in all of Scripture.

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- The anthropopathic language (“grieved,” “heartache”) has led some theologians to **spiritualize** or **philosophize** this moment into abstraction.
    
- But the Hebrew is clear: YHWH is **deeply moved** — not from ignorance or surprise, but from the pain of **righteous sorrow** over what mankind has become.
    

> This verse affirms a **personal, grieving God** — not the cold deist clockmaker of modernism.

---

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Still within AM 1600–1650**

- Follows the full spread of Nephilim influence, widespread human wickedness, and final corruption of thought.
    
- The stage is now fully set for the **decree of destruction** in the next verse.

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And it repented the LORD that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.”

**YLT:**  
“And Jehovah repenteth that He hath made man in the earth, and He grieveth Himself — unto His heart.”

**NIV:**  
“The LORD regretted that he had made human beings on the earth, and his heart was deeply troubled.”

> “Repented” (KJV) misleads without context; “regretted” (NIV) helps, but still modernizes the tone. “Grieved” (YLT, NIV) rightly retains the pathos of **divine sorrow**.

---

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

- **1 Samuel 15:11** — “It repenteth Me that I have set up Saul to be king…” — uses the same **nacham** root, again portraying YHWH as sorrowful over disobedience.
    
- **Ephesians 4:30** — “Grieve not the Holy Spirit of God…” — reaffirms that divine **grief** is real and relational.
    
- **1 Enoch 10:1–3** — begins the heavenly judgment as YHWH commands archangels to bind the watchers and cleanse the earth.
    

> Genesis 6:6 is the **emotional hinge**: the Creator’s heartbreak before His hand brings the flood.
