### **GENESIS 6:9**

_Scroll of Noaḥ_  
(Traditional Genesis 6:9)

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**These are the generations of Noaḥ: Noaḥ was a righteous man — blameless among his generation; Noaḥ walked with Elohim.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

אֵלֶּה תּוֹלְדֹת נֹחַ  
נֹחַ אִישׁ צַדִּיק תָּמִים הָיָה בְּדֹרֹתָיו  
אֶת־הָאֱלֹהִים הִתְהַלֶּךְ־נֹחַ

---

#### Transliteration:

_Elleh toledot Noaḥ:  
Noaḥ ish tzaddiq tamim hayah be’dorotav;  
et-haElohim hithallekh Noaḥ._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And these are the generations of Noe: Noe was a just man; being perfect in his generation, Noe was well-pleasing to God.”

> LXX reflects both **justice (δικαῖος)** and **completeness (τέλειος)** — affirming his covenantal and moral integrity amid corruption.

---

#### DSS (4QGen):

Fully supports the MT reading. No textual deviation. The phrase “walked with Elohim” mirrors the earlier pattern set by **Chanokh (Enoch)** in Genesis 5:24.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“These are the generations of Noaḥ” (אֵלֶּה תּוֹלְדֹת נֹחַ)**

- This opens a new **toledot (תּוֹלְדוֹת)** section — a structural scroll break within Genesis.
    

> We are now within the **Scroll of Noaḥ**, just as Genesis 5 began the **Scroll of the Generations of Adam**.

- The focus shifts from mankind generally to **YHWH’s chosen vessel** for redemption.

**“Noaḥ was a righteous man — blameless among his generation”**

- **צַדִּיק (tzaddiq)** — righteous in conduct and relationship.
    
- **תָּמִים (tamim)** — blameless, complete, morally sound.
    
- The phrase **“in his generation (בְּדֹרֹתָיו)”** has been debated:
    
    - Some read it comparatively — Noaḥ was righteous _despite_ a corrupt age.
        
    - Others read it absolutely — he was righteous _even within_ a corrupt age.
        

> Either reading affirms Noaḥ as **a singular moral anomaly** — untouched by the Nephilim or the corruption of flesh.

---

**“Noaḥ walked with Elohim”**

- **הִתְהַלֶּךְ (hithallekh)** — reflexive form of "to walk," implies **ongoing intimacy and submission**.
    
- Mirrors **Chanokh's walk** (Genesis 5:24) — suggesting Noaḥ as his spiritual successor.
    

> In a world where the imagination of man’s heart was only evil continually, Noaḥ was **walking in step with his Creator**.

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Some traditions **downplay the uniqueness of Noaḥ**, attempting to tie his righteousness solely to behavior.
    
- Yet the structure of Genesis 6:8–9 emphasizes a **sequence of grace → righteousness → intimacy**.
    

> This aligns with the **New Covenant model**: grace initiates, righteousness follows, and intimacy is the fruit.

---

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Final years before the Flood (AM 1650–1656)**

- The ark narrative will begin immediately following this verse, initiated by this record of **divine approval and trust**.

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God.”

**YLT:**  
“These are births of Noah: Noah [is] a righteous man; perfect he hath been among his generations; with God hath Noah walked.”

**NIV:**  
“This is the account of Noah and his family. Noah was a righteous man, blameless among the people of his time, and he walked faithfully with God.”

> NIV generalizes “generations” as “family,” flattening the **toledot** structure. KJV and YLT retain stronger textual fidelity.

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

- **Genesis 5:24** — “And Chanokh walked with Elohim…” — the only other man in Genesis to do so.
    
- **Hebrews 11:7** — Noaḥ is commended for **faith**, not just conduct: “By faith… he condemned the world.”
    
- **Ezekiel 14:14** — places Noaḥ alongside **Daniel and Job** as intercessory righteous men.
    

> This verse marks Noaḥ as the **counterweight to global corruption** — a man of faith, preserved for renewal.
