### **GENESIS 6:15**

_Scroll of Noaḥ_  
(Traditional Genesis 6:15)

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And this is how you shall make it: the length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, its breadth fifty cubits, and its height thirty cubits.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וְזֶה אֲשֶׁר תַּעֲשֶׂה אֹתָהּ  
שְׁלֹשׁ מֵאוֹת אַמָּה אֹרֶךְ הַתֵּבָה  
חֲמִשִּׁים אַמָּה רָחְבָּהּ  
וּשְׁלֹשִׁים אַמָּה קוֹמָתָהּ

---

#### Transliteration:

_Ve’zeh asher taʿaseh otah:  
shelosh me’ot ammah orekh ha’tevah,  
ḥamishim ammah rokhbah,  
u’sheloshim ammah qomatah._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And thus shalt thou make it: the length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth fifty cubits, and the height thirty cubits.”

> The LXX matches MT exactly. No interpretive liberties are taken here — dimensions are literal, architectural, and measurable.

---

#### DSS (4QGen):

Fully confirms MT structure — no textual variance in the command. These dimensions were preserved precisely.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“This is how you shall make it…”**

- YHWH provides **exact proportions** — not general guidance. These are **design specs**, not suggestions.
    

> The ark was to be **built to divine scale** — indicating that **salvation** must follow **YHWH’s pattern**, not human invention.

---

**Dimensions: 300 cubits long, 50 cubits wide, 30 cubits high**

- Using a conservative **Hebrew cubit** of 18 inches:
    
    - **Length** = 450 feet (137 meters)
        
    - **Width** = 75 feet (23 meters)
        
    - **Height** = 45 feet (14 meters)
        

> This is a **6:1 length-to-width ratio** — the same ratio used in **modern shipbuilding** for optimal **stability in storm conditions**.

- These proportions suggest:
    
    - **Seaworthiness** over speed
        
    - Maximum **internal volume and flotation**
        
    - A focus on **durability under judgment**
        

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Skeptics have dismissed the ark as myth due to its size — but **naval engineers** (e.g. Dr. Seon Won Hong, Korea) have affirmed the **feasibility and design excellence** of these dimensions.
    
- Some traditions spiritualize the ark, neglecting that the **text offers a concrete, buildable structure** — a sign that **YHWH’s redemption is both physical and spiritual**.
    

> The ark was not allegory — it was a **vessel of covenant obedience**, constructed in real space and time.

---

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Shortly before AM 1656**

- These specs likely mark the **beginning of final construction**, with only years remaining before the judgment waters rise.

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of: The length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.”

**YLT:**  
“And this [is] that which thou dost with it: three hundred cubits the length of the ark, fifty cubits its breadth, and thirty cubits its height.”

**NIV:**  
“This is how you are to build it: The ark is to be three hundred cubits long, fifty cubits wide and thirty cubits high.”

> All three maintain textual integrity. The NIV drops the poetic repetition but preserves the core specs.

---

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

- **Exodus 25–27** — YHWH gives similarly precise instructions for the **Ark of the Covenant** and **Tabernacle** — showing a pattern of **heaven-sourced design**.
    
- **Hebrews 8:5** — confirms that such patterns are **“copies and shadows of heavenly things.”**
    
- **Isaiah 30:33** — uses architectural language for **Topheth**, suggesting that even instruments of judgment are “prepared of old.”
    

> This verse affirms: **obedience to divine blueprint is the key to survival.** Noaḥ is not just building a boat — he’s enacting a **pattern of salvation**.
