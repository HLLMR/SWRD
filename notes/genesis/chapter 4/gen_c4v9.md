_Scroll of Adam_

#### Hebrew (MT):

וַיֹּאמֶר יְהוָה אֶל־קַיִן  
אֵי הֶבֶל אָחִיךָ  
וַיֹּאמֶר  
לֹא יָדַעְתִּי  
הֲשֹׁמֵר אָחִי אָנֹכִי

#### Transliteration:

_Vayyomer YHWH el-Qayin,  
ei Havel achikha?  
Vayyomer,  
lo yadati;  
ha-shomer achi anokhi?_

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“Where is Havel your brother?” (אֵי הֶבֶל אָחִיךָ)**

- _Ei_ = “where?” — the same question form used when YHWH asked Adam, _“Where are you?”_ (Gen 3:9).
    
- God’s inquiry is **not for information**, but **for confrontation and repentance** — a pattern seen throughout Scripture.
    

**“I do not know” (לֹא יָדַעְתִּי)**

- Direct **lie in the face of God** — Cain compounds his sin with **deceit** and **evasion**.
    
- Reflects hardened heart: not remorseful, but defiant.
    

**“Am I my brother’s keeper?” (הֲשֹׁמֵר אָחִי אָנֹכִי)**

- _Shomer_ = watchman, guardian — Cain mocks the divine order by **rejecting fraternal responsibility**.
    
- This rhetorical question is **infamous** — a declaration of **individualism, rebellion, and disconnection**, set against YHWH’s design for mutual care.
    

> This phrase echoes across later Scripture: in Ezekiel 3 and 33, _watchmen_ are commanded to warn others or be held accountable. Cain’s rejection of that role is profound.

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Many modern readers miss the **theological gravity** of this exchange: Cain lies to God, then **denies the moral order** of human accountability.
    
- In Jewish tradition, this verse becomes a **cornerstone of communal ethics** — opposite of Cain’s attitude.

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Anno Mundi ~125-129**, immediately following the murder. This is the **first recorded human lie to God** in post-Eden history.

---

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And the Lord said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not: Am I my brother’s keeper?”

**YLT:**  
“And Jehovah saith unto Cain, ‘Where is Abel thy brother?’ and he saith, ‘I have not known — my brother’s keeper — I?’”

**NIV:**  
“Then the Lord said to Cain, ‘Where is your brother Abel?’ ‘I don’t know,’ he replied. ‘Am I my brother’s keeper?’”

_All three are faithful to the MT. KJV and NIV preserve the **iconic phrasing** best._

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

**Jubilees 4:9–10** — expands the scene with Cain **hiding Abel’s body** and being summoned by YHWH. Adds emotional dimension to God’s interrogation.

**1 John 3:12** — identifies Cain’s actions as the **prototype of evil** and lawlessness.

**Isaiah 58:6–7** — later contrasts this spirit with God’s true desire: that His people care for one another, becoming _keepers_ of the oppressed.
