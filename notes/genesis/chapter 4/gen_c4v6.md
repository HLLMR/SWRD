### **GENESIS 4:6**

_Scroll of Adam_

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And YHWH said to Qayin, “Why are you angry? And why has your face fallen?”**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וַיֹּאמֶר יְהוָה אֶל־קָיִן  
לָמָּה חָרָה לָךְ  
וְלָמָּה נָפְלוּ פָּנֶיךָ

---

#### Transliteration:

_Vayyomer YHWH el-Qayin:  
Lamah charah lakh,  
ve’lamah naflu paneikha?_

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And the Lord God said to Cain, ‘Why are you become very sorrowful? And why has your countenance fallen?’”

_LXX continues softening “anger” into “sorrow.”_

---

#### DSS (4QGen-Exoda):

Aligns with MT — especially supports interrogative repetition and the sharp use of _charah_ (burned with anger). Reaffirms the emotional tone is **rage**, not mere sadness.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“Why are you angry?” (לָמָּה חָרָה לָךְ)**

- _Charah_ = burned, inflamed — often used of **divine wrath** (e.g., Exod 4:14).
    
- YHWH is **confronting Cain’s emotional state directly**, not just his behavior.
    
- This is the first recorded **divine dialogue post-Eden** — highlighting Cain’s inner crisis.
    

**“Why has your face fallen?” (נָפְלוּ פָּנֶיךָ)**

- A Hebrew idiom reflecting **internal despair, shame, or rebellious sulking**.
    
- In context, this question is not rhetorical — it’s a **merciful call to repentance**.
    

> Note: These dual questions echo **God’s pattern of mercy before judgment**:
> 
> - “Where are you?” → Adam
>     
> - “What have you done?” → Eve
>     
> - “Why are you angry?” → Cain
>     

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- LXX and some modern commentaries **deflect the intensity** of Cain’s emotion, minimizing its **sinful trajectory**.
    
- The direct divine questioning shows that **Cain’s emotional rebellion is being warned and corrected**, not predestined or unjustly triggered.

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Anno Mundi ~100-125**, likely **moments or hours after the offering** — a direct intervention before Cain commits murder.

---

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And the Lord said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen?”

**YLT:**  
“And Jehovah saith unto Cain, ‘Why hast thou displeasure? and why hath thy countenance fallen?’”

**NIV:**  
“Then the Lord said to Cain, ‘Why are you angry? Why is your face downcast?’”

_NIV matches MT well. KJV preserves stronger emotion. YLT understates. LXX shifts entirely toward grief over rage._

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

**Jubilees 4:6–7** — adds that God gave Cain **instruction** and **space to repent**, but Cain hardened his heart.

**Sirach 10:6–7** (deutero): warns against **wrath as sin’s root**, mirroring this verse.

**James 1:19–20** — “the wrath of man does not produce the righteousness of God,” fitting commentary on Cain’s state.
