### **GENESIS 4:12**

_Scroll of Adam_

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**When you work the ground, it shall no longer yield its strength to you. A wanderer and a fugitive you shall be in the earth.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

כִּי תַעֲבֹד אֶת־הָאֲדָמָה  
לֹא־תוֹסֵף תֵּת־כֹּחָהּ לָךְ  
נָע וָנָד תִּהְיֶה בָּאָרֶץ

---

#### Transliteration:

_Ki ta’avod et-ha’adamah,  
lo-tosef tet-kochah lakh;  
na va’nad tihyeh ba’aretz._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“When you till the earth, it shall not henceforth yield to you its strength; you shall be groaning and trembling on the earth.”

_The LXX renders “na va’nad” as “groaning and trembling” — a **semantic shift** from the MT’s “wanderer and fugitive.”_

---

#### DSS (4QGen-Exoda):

Fully aligns with the Masoretic Text — **“wanderer and fugitive”** phrase is retained. No textual deviation from MT.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“It shall no longer yield its strength to you” (לֹא־תוֹסֵף תֵּת־כֹּחָהּ לָךְ)**

- _Tosef tet-kochah_ = “will no longer continue to give her strength.”
    
- Cain’s ability to produce crops is **severed at the source** — the ground itself resists him.
    
- This is a **step beyond Adam’s curse** (Gen 3:17–19) — not toil, but **total futility**.
    

**“Wanderer and fugitive” (נָע וָנָד)**

- _Na va’nad_ — unique pairing.
    
    - _Na_ = to shake, stagger, or waver (a nomad).
        
    - _Nad_ = to flee, retreat, or be dislodged.
        
- This is **not just physical exile** — it implies **spiritual rootlessness**, **disconnection from society**, and **cosmic dislocation**.
    

> Cain is now **homeless**, **fruitless**, and **displaced from covenantal geography**.

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- LXX’s translation “groaning and trembling” became influential in later traditions (e.g., Syriac, some Church Fathers) — but loses the nomadic and **judicial exile** implications of the MT.
    
- Some interpretations downplay the **severity of the curse**, portraying Cain more as a tragic anti-hero than a **marked rebel under divine judgment**.

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Anno Mundi ~125-129**  
This curse defines Cain’s existence **from this moment forward**, likely leading directly into the next narrative section (Cain’s response in verse 13).

---

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.”

**YLT:**  
“When thou tillest the ground, it doth not add to give its strength to thee — a wanderer, even a trembling one, thou art in the earth.”

**NIV:**  
“When you work the ground, it will no longer yield its crops for you. You will be a restless wanderer on the earth.”

_NIV simplifies to “restless wanderer,” which loses the **judicial** or **banished** tone. KJV stays close to MT; YLT interestingly retains “trembling,” perhaps bridging MT and LXX._

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

**Jubilees 4:12–13** — expands on Cain’s curse: “You shall groan and tremble and never find rest… the earth shall not give you peace.”

**Psalm 109:10** — “Let his children be continually vagabonds and beg…” — often used as a judgment curse echoing Cain’s condition.

**Isaiah 57:20–21** — “The wicked are like the troubled sea… there is no peace, says my God, for the wicked.” Parallels Cain’s fate.
