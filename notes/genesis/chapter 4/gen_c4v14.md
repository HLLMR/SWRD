### **GENESIS 4:14**

_Scroll of Adam_

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**Behold, You have driven me out this day from the face of the ground, and from Your face I shall be hidden. And I shall be a wanderer and fugitive in the earth, and it shall come to pass, whoever finds me shall slay me.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

הֵן גֵּרַשְׁתָּ אֹתִי הַיּוֹם  
מֵעַל פְּנֵי הָאֲדָמָה  
וּמִפָּנֶיךָ אֶסָּתֵר  
וְהָיִיתִי נָע וָנָד בָּאָרֶץ  
וְהָיָה כָּל־מֹצְאִי יַהַרְגֵנִי

---

#### Transliteration:

_Hen gerashta oti hayom  
me’al penei ha’adamah,  
u’mipaneikha essater;  
ve’hayiti na va’nad ba’aretz,  
ve’hayah kol motz’i yahargeni._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“If You cast me out this day from off the face of the earth, and I shall be hidden from Your presence, and I shall be groaning and trembling on the earth, then it will be that everyone who finds me shall slay me.”

_LXX again uses “groaning and trembling” instead of “wanderer and fugitive.”_

---

#### DSS (4QGen-Exoda):

Supports MT phrasing throughout. No deviation in “wanderer and fugitive” or Cain’s fear of being killed.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“You have driven me out this day” (גֵּרַשְׁתָּ אֹתִי הַיּוֹם)**

- _Gerashta_ (גֵּרַשְׁתָּ) = expelled, banished — same verb used in **Genesis 3:24** for Adam and Eve being driven from the garden.
    
- Now Cain is doubly driven — from **ground** and from **God’s presence**.
    

**“From Your face I shall be hidden” (וּמִפָּנֶיךָ אֶסָּתֵר)**

- First declaration of **estrangement from YHWH**.
    
- _Essater_ = to be concealed, veiled — suggests **divine withdrawal** or **loss of covenant access**.
    

**“Wanderer and fugitive” repeated**

- Reaffirms the earlier curse — Cain internalizes his **social and spiritual exile**.
    

**“Whoever finds me shall slay me” (כָּל־מֹצְאִי יַהַרְגֵנִי)**

- Implies the **existence of other people** — possibly siblings or extended kin.
    
- Raises major chronological questions: who else was alive?

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Traditional commentators avoid the implications of **other humans existing** already — yet Gen 5:4 confirms **Adam had other sons and daughters**.
    
- Cain’s fear is **not irrational**; the Bible assumes rapid population growth in early generations.
    

> This verse undermines the “Adam, Eve, Cain, Abel — and no one else” children’s-Bible narrative.

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Anno Mundi ~125-129**, still within Cain’s immediate post-judgment dialogue.

If Cain was born around AM 30–40, and Abel slain shortly before AM 130 (Seth’s birth), the intervening 90–100 years could have produced **dozens** of siblings, cousins, or early tribes.

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid… it shall come to pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me.”

**YLT:**  
“Lo, Thou hast driven me today from off the face of the ground, and from Thy face I am hid… and it hath come to pass, every one finding me doth slay me.”

**NIV:**  
“Today You are driving me from the land, and I will be hidden from Your presence; I will be a restless wanderer on the earth, and whoever finds me will kill me.”

_NIV oversimplifies “wanderer and fugitive” to “restless wanderer”; KJV and YLT better preserve formal structure._

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

**Jubilees 4:13–14** — expands on Cain’s exile, noting that fear of death was genuine due to Abel’s kin seeking justice.

**Genesis 5:4** — confirms Adam had “sons and daughters” beyond Cain, Abel, and Seth — validating Cain’s concern.

**Job 1:12** — parallels this dynamic: Satan can touch Job but only within defined bounds — hinting that **divine marks or restraints** are real and honored.
