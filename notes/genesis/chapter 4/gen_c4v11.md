### **GENESIS 4:11**

_Scroll of Adam_

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And now, cursed are you from the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother’s bloods from your hand.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וְעַתָּה  
אָרוּר אָתָּה מִן־הָאֲדָמָה  
אֲשֶׁר פָּצְתָה אֶת־פִּיהָ  
לָקַחַת אֶת־דְּמֵי אָחִיךָ  
מִיָּדֶךָ

---

#### Transliteration:

_Ve’atah  
arur atah min-ha’adamah  
asher patztah et-piha  
laqachat et-d’mei achikha  
miyadekha._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And now you are cursed from the earth, which has opened her mouth to receive the blood of your brother from your hand.”

_LXX closely mirrors MT. It interprets “opened her mouth” poetically — no doctrinal variance._

---

#### DSS (4QGen-Exoda):

Fully aligns with MT. No significant textual variants. The phrasing _“opened its mouth”_ and _“bloods”_ is preserved.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“And now, cursed are you…” (וְעַתָּה אָרוּר אָתָּה)**

- Echoes Gen 3:14 — **same structure** used when the serpent was cursed.
    
- Only two individuals are directly cursed by YHWH in Genesis: **the serpent and Cain**.
    
- This marks **divine judicial judgment**, not mere consequence.
    

**“From the ground” (מִן־הָאֲדָמָה)**

- Not just cursed **upon** the ground (like Adam) — Cain is cursed **from it**.
    
- The ground itself becomes **hostile** to him — severing his connection to the soil and productivity.
    

**“Which opened its mouth…” (אֲשֶׁר פָּצְתָה אֶת־פִּיהָ)**

- Anthropomorphic image — the ground is portrayed as a **witness and participant** in divine justice.
    
- See Num 16:32 (Korah’s rebellion) — same phrase: the earth opens its mouth to devour.
    

**“To receive your brother’s bloods” (אֶת־דְּמֵי אָחִיךָ)**

- As footnoted earlier: **plural “bloods”** signifies both Abel and his **unborn descendants**.
    
- The earth, defiled by this act, can no longer bless Cain.
    

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- The phrase “from the ground” is often **mistranslated or flattened**, hiding the **relational break** between Cain and creation.
    
- “Bloods” is frequently rendered singular, erasing the theological richness tied to generational justice.

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Anno Mundi ~125-129  
This is the official **divine judgment decree**. Cain is now spiritually and agriculturally severed from his environment.

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And now art thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother’s blood from thy hand.”

**YLT:**  
“And now, cursed [art] thou from the ground, which hath opened her mouth to receive the blood of thy brother from thy hand;”

**NIV:**  
“Now you are under a curse and driven from the ground, which opened its mouth to receive your brother’s blood from your hand.”

_NIV adds interpretive phrase “driven from the ground” (not in Hebrew); KJV and YLT are more literal but miss the plural “bloods.”_

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

**Jubilees 4:11–13** — Cain is told he shall never again have rest upon the earth, and he becomes a wanderer.

**Deuteronomy 21:1–9** — law for unsolved murders echoes this passage: innocent blood defiles the land and must be atoned for.

**Revelation 6:9–10** — “the souls of those slain… cried out” — directly mirrors this idea of _bloods crying from the ground_.
