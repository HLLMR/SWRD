### **GENESIS 4:2**

_(Scroll of Adam)_

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And she again bore his brother Havel. And Havel became a keeper of flocks, but Qayin was a tiller of the ground.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וַתֹּסֶף לָלֶדֶת  
אֶת־אָחִיו אֶת־הָבֶל  
וַיְהִי־הֶבֶל רֹעֵה צֹאן  
וְקַיִן הָיָה עֹבֵד אֲדָמָה

---

#### Transliteration:

_Vattosef laledet  
et-achiv et-Havel;  
vayehi Havel ro’eh tzon,  
ve-Qayin hayah oved adamah._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And she again bore his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.”

_Structure closely mirrors MT, no major divergence._

---

#### DSS (4QGen-Exoda):

Confirms the MT structure — especially the repetition of _et_ before both “brother” and “Havel,” which may imply **distinct narrative emphasis**.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“She again bore” (וַתֹּסֶף לָלֶדֶת)**

- _Vattosef_ = “she continued,” not necessarily “bore immediately after.”
    
- This verb **does not imply twins**, though some traditions assume so. The **grammar supports a second, distinct birth event**.
    

**“His brother Havel” (אָחִיו הָבֶל)**

- The repetition of _et_ twice (_et-achiv, et-Havel_) is grammatically unusual — likely emphasizes that **Havel is not just a biological brother**, but a **narrative foil**.
    
- _Havel (הָבֶל)_ = “breath,” “vanity,” or “vapor.” A name often interpreted as **ephemeral**, possibly foreshadowing his short life (cf. Ecclesiastes’ theme).
    

**“Keeper of flocks” (רֹעֵה צֹאן)**

- _Ro’eh tzon_ = a **herdsman** or **shepherd**.
    
- Indicates **domestication** already underway — likely **sheep or goats**, not wild animals.
    
- Symbolically linked to **later righteous figures** (Abraham, Moses, David).
    

**“Tiller of the ground” (עֹבֵד אֲדָמָה)**

- _Oved adamah_ = cultivator of the soil.
    
- Mirrors the curse Adam received in Gen 3:17–19.
    
- Cain’s occupation is rooted in **toil and the cursed ground**, not the voluntary stewardship of Eden.

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Some traditions imply twinship based on narrative proximity — but Hebrew syntax implies otherwise.
    
- Rabbinic legends and Gnostic texts assign extra siblings (e.g., twin sisters), but **Genesis is silent** on this point.
    
- Abel’s name is rarely given the weight it deserves: a **prophetic commentary on the brevity and fragility of life** post-fall.

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Anno Mundi ~30–40** — likely a few years after Cain.  
Given the establishment of vocations, both brothers are **adolescents or young adults** before the next verse (the offering). The time window may extend to AM 50+ before that event.

---

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And she again bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.”

**YLT:**  
“And she addeth to bear his brother, even Abel. And Abel is feeding a flock, and Cain hath been servant of the ground.”

**NIV:**  
“Later she gave birth to his brother Abel. Now Abel kept flocks, and Cain worked the soil.”

_NIV’s “later” clarifies that it was a separate birth, but “worked the soil” is more interpretive than literal. YLT emphasizes labor._

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

**Jubilees 4:1–2** — assigns dates: Cain at AM 30, Abel at AM 32. These support the **non-twin reading** and reflect early vocational roles.

**Book of Jasher 1:12–15** — describes their occupations and the growing tension between them.

**1 Enoch 22:5–7** — implies Abel’s soul still speaks from Sheol — later echoed in **Hebrews 11:4** and **Genesis 4:10**.
