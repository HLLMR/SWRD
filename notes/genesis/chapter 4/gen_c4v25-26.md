### **GENESIS 4:25–26**

_Scroll of Adam_

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And Adam knew his wife again, and she bore a son and called his name Shet: “For Elohim has appointed me another seed in place of Havel, because Qayin killed him.”  
And to Shet also there was born a son, and he called his name Enosh. Then it was begun to call upon the Name of YHWH.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וַיֵּדַע אָדָם עוֹד אֶת־אִשְׁתּוֹ וַתֵּלֶד בֵּן וַתִּקְרָא אֶת־שְׁמוֹ שֵׁת  
כִּי שָׁת־לִי אֱלֹהִים זֶרַע אַחֵר תַּחַת הֶבֶל כִּי הֲרָגוֹ קָיִן  
וּלְשֵׁת גַּם־הוּא יֻלַּד־בֵּן וַיִּקְרָא אֶת־שְׁמוֹ אֱנוֹשׁ  
אָז הוּחַל לִקְרֹא בְּשֵׁם יְהוָה

---

#### Transliteration:

_Vayyedaʿ Adam ʿod et-ishto, vatteled ben, vattiqra et-shemo Shet:  
ki shat-li Elohim zeraʿ acher tachat Hevel ki harago Qayin.  
Ul’Shet gam-hu yullad ben, vayyiqra et-shemo Enosh.  
Az huchal liqro b’Shem YHWH._

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And Adam knew his wife, and she bore a son, and called his name Seth, saying, For God has raised up to me another seed instead of Abel, whom Cain slew.  
And to Seth, a son was born, and he called his name Enos: he hoped to call on the name of the Lord God.”

> The LXX adds interpretive nuance: “he hoped to call” rather than “then it was begun.”

---

#### DSS (4QGen-Exoda):

Follows the MT closely — confirms Seth and Enosh, and the phrase _liqro b’Shem YHWH_ is intact. No evidence of added LXX interpretive phrasing.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“Seth” (שֵׁת / Shet)**

- Root _shat_ (שָׁת) = “to set,” “appoint,” or “place.”
    
- Eve’s naming explicitly marks Seth as **divinely appointed** replacement for Abel.
    

**“Seed” (זֶרַע)**

- Singular **zeraʿ** often implies a **specific lineage or promise** — foundational to later Messianic seed prophecies.
    

> Seth is not just another son — he is the **appointed continuator of the righteous line**.

**“Then it was begun to call upon the Name of YHWH”**

- Hebrew: _Az huchal liqro b’Shem YHWH_
    
    - _Huchal_ = “was begun,” from _chalal_ — literally “to begin,” sometimes “to profane” depending on usage.
        
    - Most ancient and rabbinic sources take this to mean **public invocation** of YHWH began here — possibly **prayer, worship, or covenantal identity**.
        

> The **first mention of YHWH being called upon** — a major milestone in redemptive history.

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Some rabbinic sources interpret _huchal_ here negatively — “then began profanity” — but the textual flow and tradition strongly support a **positive religious renewal**.
    
- Cain’s line ends in escalation of violence; Seth’s begins with **renewed worship** and the **first public identification with YHWH**.
    
- Traditions that merge all early humanity together obscure the **lineage distinction** here — but Genesis clearly sets Seth’s line apart.

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Anno Mundi 130–235**

- Seth is born **at AM 130** (Gen 5:3 confirms).
    
- Enosh born **at AM 235** (when Seth is 105 years old).
    

> The return to calling on YHWH’s Name likely began **in Enosh’s lifetime**, suggesting a generational shift toward spiritual identity.

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called his name Seth: For God, said she, hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel, whom Cain slew.  
And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enos: then began men to call upon the name of the LORD.”

**YLT:**  
“And Adam again knoweth his wife, and she beareth a son, and calleth his name Seth: ‘for God hath appointed for me another seed instead of Abel—because Cain had slain him.’  
And to Seth, to him also a son hath been born, and he calleth his name Enos; then a beginning was made to call in the name of Jehovah.”

**NIV:**  
“Adam made love to his wife again, and she gave birth to a son and named him Seth, saying, ‘God has granted me another child in place of Abel, since Cain killed him.’  
Seth also had a son, and he named him Enosh. At that time people began to call on the name of the Lord.”

> NIV adds “people” and modern euphemism “made love,” which obscures the Hebrew verb _yadaʿ_’s **covenantal and reproductive** depth.

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

**Genesis 5:3–8** — further clarifies Seth’s genealogy and exact age at Enosh’s birth.

**Jubilees 4:7–14** — expands on Seth’s righteousness and begins to bridge toward Enoch.

**Luke 3:38** — Seth and Enosh appear in Yeshua’s genealogy, confirming the **Zeraʿ** (Seed) line continues through them.
