### **GENESIS 4:1**

_Scroll of Adam_

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And the man knew Ḥavvah his wife, and she conceived and bore Qayin, and she said, “I have acquired a man with YHWH.”**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וְהָאָדָם יָדַע אֶת־חַוָּה אִשְׁתּוֹ  
וַתַּהַר וַתֵּלֶד אֶת־קַיִן  
וַתֹּאמֶר קָנִיתִי אִישׁ אֶת־יְהוָה

---

#### Transliteration:

_Ve’ha’adam yada et-Ḥavvah ishto;  
vattahar vatteled et-Qayin;  
vattomer: qaniti ish et-YHWH._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And Adam knew Eve his wife, and she conceived and brought forth Cain, and said, I have gotten a man through God.”

_Note: LXX uses “through God” (_διὰ τοῦ θεοῦ_) rather than “with YHWH.” The Tetragrammaton is not preserved._

---

#### DSS (4QGen-Exoda):

Fully agrees with MT — confirms the use of _YHWH_ (not Adonai or Elohim) and the form _qaniti_ (“I have acquired”).

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“And the man knew Ḥavvah his wife”**

- _Yada_ = intimate knowledge; this is the Hebrew euphemism for **sexual union**, with **covenantal overtones**.
    
- This initiates the post-Eden **human lineage**.
    

**“Ḥavvah” (חַוָּה)**

- Her name is retained in transliteration rather than Anglicized (“Eve”), preserving its Hebrew meaning: **life-giver** or **mother of all living** (cf. 3:20).
    

**“She conceived and bore Qayin” (וַתֵּלֶד אֶת־קַיִן)**

- _Qayin_ (Cain) is related to _qanah_ — to acquire, get, or possess.
    
- The name is a **pun** on the declaration: _qaniti ish_ — “I have acquired a man.”
    

**“With YHWH” (אֶת־יְהוָה)**

- This is a rare construction: _et-YHWH_ could mean “with the help of YHWH,” but also bears theological weight.
    
- Ḥavvah may believe this child is **the promised seed** of Genesis 3:15.
    
- Alternatively, the phrase may be a prophetic irony: **she thinks he is righteous seed**, but he becomes the **first murderer**.

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- The phrase _et-YHWH_ is **deliberately muted** in many modern versions to avoid controversy over divine agency or messianic expectation.
    
- LXX obscures the Tetragrammaton entirely, weakening the theological thrust.
    
- Catholic Mariology draws from similar themes (mother + divine man), which may contribute to interpretive hesitancy here.

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Anno Mundi ~30–100**, most likely **~30–40 AM**.

Here’s the logic:

- **Genesis 5:3** says Adam was **130 years old when Seth was born**, “a son in his own likeness, after his image.”
    
- **Seth was born after Abel’s death** (Gen 4:25) — meaning **Cain and Abel were both born and had grown into adults** by then.
    
- Given agricultural and pastoral activity (Gen 4:2–3), Cain and Abel were likely **not children** but **young adults** when the offering incident occurred.
    
- That places **Cain’s birth likely around AM 30–40**, assuming:
    
    - Adam and Havvah begin family life soon after expulsion from Eden.
        
    - Abel follows shortly after.
        
    - Abel is killed, and Seth is born sometime later as replacement.
        

So Cain’s birth almost certainly predates AM 100 — the earlier estimate of AM 130–135 in the prior version was an **overextension** tied too closely to Seth’s birth.

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and said, I have gotten a man from the Lord.”

**YLT:**  
“And the man knew Eve his wife, and she conceiveth and beareth Cain, and saith, ‘I have gotten a man by Jehovah;’”

**NIV:**  
“Adam made love to his wife Eve, and she became pregnant and gave birth to Cain. She said, ‘With the help of the Lord I have brought forth a man.’”

_NIV softens “knew” into “made love,” which is an interpretive paraphrase. “With the help of the Lord” adds theological bias._

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

**Genesis 3:15** — direct echo of the **Seed prophecy**, though likely misunderstood by Ḥavvah.

**Book of Jasher 1:9–12** — expands on Cain’s birth and later actions with additional moral commentary.

**Jubilees 4:1–2** — specifies the timing of Cain and Abel’s births and states that Cain built a city — possibly evidence of early civil society.
