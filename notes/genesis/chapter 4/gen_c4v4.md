### **GENESIS 4:4**

_Scroll of Adam_

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And Havel also brought — from the firstborn of his flock, and from their fat portions. And YHWH looked with favor upon Havel and his offering.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וְהֶבֶל הֵבִיא גַם־הוּא  
מִבְּכֹרוֹת צֹאנֹו  
וּמֵחֶלְבֵהֶן  
וַיִּשַׁע יְהוָה אֶל־הֶבֶל וְאֶל־מִנְחָתוֹ

---

#### Transliteration:

_Ve’Havel hevi gam-hu  
mibekhorot tsono  
u’me’chelvehen;  
vayyisha YHWH el-Havel ve’el-minchato._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And Abel also brought, even he, of the firstlings of his sheep, and of their fatlings. And God looked upon Abel and his gifts.”

---

#### DSS (4QGen-Exoda):

Fully supports the MT wording. Confirms _bekhorot_ (firstborn) and _chelvehen_ (their fat portions) — **emphasizing Abel’s careful selection**.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“Also he brought” (גַּם־הוּא)**

- _Gam-hu_ = “also he himself” — implies **personal, voluntary initiative**, not just obligation.
    
- Emphasizes **intentionality** — Abel’s offering was an act of worship, not ritual compliance.
    

**“From the firstborn of his flock” (מִבְּכֹרוֹת צֹאנֹו)**

- _Mibekhorot_ = from the firstborn — the **best and earliest**, which carried **cultural and sacrificial significance** (cf. Exod 13:2, Deut 15:19).
    
- Suggests **faith and reverence** — Abel gives the **choicest portion**, unlike Cain.
    

**“And from their fat portions” (וּמֵחֶלְבֵהֶן)**

- _Chelev_ = fat or richest parts — seen later in Torah as the **most sacred part of an offering** (Lev 3:16).
    
- The inclusion of fat indicates **full submission and costly sacrifice**.
    

**“YHWH looked with favor” (וַיִּשַׁע יְהוָה)**

- _Vayyisha_ = “turned toward,” “looked favorably upon” — implying **acceptance and blessing**.
    
- Acceptance is not just for the gift, but also **for the man** (cf. Hebrews 11:4).

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Catholic and Reformed traditions often pit **blood vs. grain** as the key difference, but the text puts the emphasis on **faithful intent and heart posture** (see Heb 11:4).
    
- The fat portion is rarely emphasized in modern preaching, yet it **clearly aligns Abel’s offering with later Levitical standards**.

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Anno Mundi ~100-125**, immediately following Cain’s offering. This is likely the **first recorded act of true worship** and faith-based giving in post-Eden human history.

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And the Lord had respect unto Abel and to his offering.”

**YLT:**  
“And Abel, he also hath brought of the firstlings of his flock, even of their fat ones, and Jehovah looketh unto Abel and unto his present,”

**NIV:**  
“And Abel also brought an offering—fat portions from some of the firstborn of his flock. The Lord looked with favor on Abel and his offering.”

_NIV’s “fat portions from some” subtly downplays the full sacrificial cost. KJV/YLT preserve more of the weight._

---

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

**Hebrews 11:4** — Abel’s offering is called a **“more excellent sacrifice”** offered **by faith**.

**Jubilees 4:4** — Abel is described as upright, bringing the firstlings and **their fat**, indicating he knew **what pleased YHWH**.

**Book of Jasher 1:15–17** — expands on the sacrificial setting and God’s response, adding further spiritual symbolism.
