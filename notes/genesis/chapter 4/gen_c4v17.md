### **GENESIS 4:17**

_Scroll of Adam_

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And Qayin knew his wife, and she conceived and bore Chanokh. And he was building a city, and he called the name of the city after the name of his son — Chanokh.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וַיֵּדַע קַיִן אֶת־אִשְׁתּוֹ  
וַתַּהַר וַתֵּלֶד אֶת־חֲנוֹךְ  
וַיְהִי בֹנֶה עִיר  
וַיִּקְרָא שֵׁם הָעִיר  
כְּשֵׁם בְּנוֹ חֲנוֹךְ

---

#### Transliteration:

_Vayedaʿ Qayin et-ishto,  
vattahar vatteled et-Chanokh;  
vay’hi boneh ʿir,  
vayikra shem haʿir  
k’shem beno Chanokh._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And Cain knew his wife, and having conceived, she bore Enoch; and he built a city, and called the name of the city after the name of his son Enoch.”

_The LXX follows MT closely, with minor syntactical smoothing._

---

#### DSS (4QGen-Exoda):

No textual deviation from MT. The sequence — conception, birth, city-building, and naming — is confirmed.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“And Qayin knew his wife…”**

- Implies a **previously existing wife**, not newly introduced.
    
- Supports the view that **many sons and daughters** were born to Adam (cf. Gen 5:4) — Cain’s wife was likely a **sister** or **niece**.
    

**“She conceived and bore Chanokh” (חֲנוֹךְ)**

- _Chanokh_ = “initiated,” “dedicated,” or “disciplined.”
    
- Name carries connotation of beginning something new — fitting for a foundational figure in Cain’s line.
    

**“He was building a city” (וַיְהִי בֹנֶה עִיר)**

- Unusual phrasing: _vayehi boneh_ = “he was in the act of building.”
    
- Suggests **ongoing construction** — not yet complete.
    
- **First city** in biblical history — precedes Babel and Jerusalem.
    

> This marks the **origin of urban society** — Cainite civilization emerges not from Eden, but exile.

**“He called the name of the city… Chanokh”**

- City is named after his son, not himself.
    
- Possibly an effort at **legacy repair** — Cain’s name is cursed, but his son’s is honored.
    

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Traditional interpretation avoids pressing on Cain’s wife — but Genesis assumes the reader understands **rapid early population growth**.
    

> No angels, aliens, or external lineages are needed. All humans come from Adam.

- Early city-building undermines the notion that civilization began much later. Cain’s line develops **tools, culture, and music** before the Flood (see vv. 20–22).
    

---

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Anno Mundi ~129–130**

- Chanokh is likely born just before Seth (AM 130).
    
- Cain builds the city during his exile, not long after his judgment — fulfilling his role as founder of an exilic society.

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and he builded a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch.”

**YLT:**  
“And Cain knoweth his wife, and she conceiveth, and beareth Enoch; and he is building a city, and calleth the name of the city after the name of his son—Enoch.”

**NIV:**  
“Cain made love to his wife, and she became pregnant and gave birth to Enoch. Cain was then building a city, and he named it after his son Enoch.”

_Note: NIV’s “made love” is a modern euphemism — technically accurate, but lacks the **textual consistency** of “knew.”_

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

**Jubilees 4:9–11** — identifies Cain’s wife as Awan (his sister), and confirms Chanokh’s birth and the building of a city.

**Genesis 5:18–24** — a **different Chanokh** will appear in Seth’s line; this verse anchors the **Cainite Chanokh**, who is part of a divergent lineage.

**1 Enoch 6:1–2** — introduces watchers descending _in the days of Jared_, not Chanokh — no conflict here yet.
