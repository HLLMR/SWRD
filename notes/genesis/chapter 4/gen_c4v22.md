### **GENESIS 4:22**

_Scroll of Adam_

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And Tzillah—she also bore Tubal-Qayin, forger of every cutting instrument of bronze and iron. And the sister of Tubal-Qayin was Naʿamah.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וְצִלָּה גַּם־הִוא יָלְדָה אֶת־תּוּבַל קַיִן  
לֹטֵשׁ כָּל־חֹרֵשׁ נְחֹשֶׁת וּבַרְזֶל  
וַאֲחוֹת תּוּבַל קַיִן נַעֲמָה

---

#### Transliteration:

_VeTzillah gam hi yaldah et-Tuval-Qayin,  
lotesh kol-choresh nechoshet u’varzel;  
va’achot Tuval-Qayin Naʿamah._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And Sella also bore Thobel; and he was a smith, a manufacturer both of brass and iron; and the sister of Thobel was Noema.”

> The LXX simplifies the descriptor to “smith,” but otherwise preserves the same idea. Note phonetic variants: “Thobel” for Tuval and “Noema” for Naʿamah.

---

#### DSS (4QGen-Exoda):

Matches MT structure and name spellings; confirms both metallurgy and the sister Naʿamah appear in the original early text tradition.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“Tubal-Qayin” (תּוּבַל קַיִן)**

- Compound name:
    
    - _Tuval_ = “increase,” “flowing forth,” or “offspring of.”
        
    - _Qayin_ = possibly “smith” or “metalworker,” but also connects him symbolically to **Cain’s legacy**.
        
- Name may literally mean: **“Smith of Cain”** or **“offspring of Cain’s trade.”**
    

> A clear **trade-identifier name**, like a guild founder. Possibly the **first metallurgist** or toolsmith.

**“Forger of every cutting instrument of bronze and iron”**

- _Lotesh_ (לֹטֵשׁ) = to sharpen, hammer, or forge.
    
- _Choresh_ (חֹרֵשׁ) = cutting or engraving tool — not only weapons, but also tools for farming or crafting.
    
- _Nechoshet_ = bronze (or copper alloys), _Barzel_ = iron — both indicate **advanced metallurgy**, long before traditional timelines would allow it.
    

> This verse is often cited as **anomaly** by secular archaeology — the presence of **bronze and iron technology** in the pre-Flood era contradicts evolutionary metallurgy charts.

**“Naʿamah” (נַעֲמָה)**

- Root meaning = “pleasant,” “lovely,” or “graceful.”
    
- Only woman named in Cain’s line — suggests **notable reputation**.
    
- Rabbinic tradition speculates variously:
    
    - Wife of Noah (unsupported by Genesis 6),
        
    - Or the origin of early cultic or artistic practices (speculative).
        

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- The presence of iron this early is awkward for evolutionary timelines — often dismissed as **anachronistic or symbolic**.
    
- Some traditions **erase Naʿamah’s significance**, but her inclusion suggests she played a **cultural or social role**, possibly in ritual, craft, or musical spheres (per later traditions).
    

> This is **pre-Flood industrialism** — metallurgy, livestock management, music — all firmly rooted in the Cainite line.

---

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Anno Mundi ~350–400**

Tubal-Qayin and Naʿamah likely represent a mature society with **specialized vocations**, indicating **rapid post-Edenic development**. This generation overlaps the early adult life of Seth and precedes the rise of Enosh.

---

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And Zillah, she also bare Tubal-cain, an instructer of every artificer in brass and iron: and the sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah.”

**YLT:**  
“And Zillah, she also hath borne Tubal-Cain, an instructor of every artificer in brass and iron; and a sister of Tubal-Cain is Naamah.”

**NIV:**  
“Zillah also had a son, Tubal-Cain, who forged all kinds of tools out of bronze and iron. Tubal-Cain’s sister was Naamah.”

> “Instructor” (KJV/YLT) softens _lotesh_ — “forger” or “smith” is more accurate. The NIV handles the technical roles well.

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

**Jubilees 4:22–23** — mentions Naʿamah as a daughter of Lamekh, names her in genealogical continuity.

**1 Enoch 8:1–2** — names fallen angels (Watchers) as having taught mankind **metalwork, ornamentation, and sorcery** — a possible echo or corruption of Tubal-Qayin’s legacy.

**Ecclesiastes 7:29** — “God made man upright, but they have sought out many inventions” — a potential critique of technological acceleration apart from righteousness.
