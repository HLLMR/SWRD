### **GENESIS 4:21**

_Scroll of Adam_

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And the name of his brother was Yuval: he was the father of all those who handle the harp and the pipe.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וְשֵׁם אָחִיו יוּבָל  
הוּא הָיָה אֲבִי כָּל־תֹּפֵשׂ כִּנּוֹר וְעוּגָב

---

#### Transliteration:

_Veshem achiv Yuval;  
hu hayah avi kol tofesh kinnor veʿugav._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And the name of his brother was Jubal: he it was who invented the psaltery and harp.”

> LXX slightly editorializes with “invented,” though MT simply states he was the **father/originator**.

---

#### DSS (4QGen-Exoda):

Consistent with the MT — preserves the names and instrumental terms clearly.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“Yuval” (יוּבָל)**

- From the same root as _Yaval_ — meaning “to bring,” “to flow,” or “to lead.”
    
- Associated with **jubilation**, **celebration**, or **flowing movement** — appropriate for music.
    

**“He was the father of all those who handle the harp and the pipe”**

- _Avi_ = cultural founder, not merely biological.
    
- _Kinnor (כִּנּוֹר)_ = a **stringed instrument**, usually translated as **lyre or harp**.
    
- _Ugav (עוּגָב)_ = debated, but most agree it's a **reed or wind instrument**, possibly **flute** or **panpipe**.
    

> This is the **first mention of music** in the Bible — showing that **artistic expression** was cultivated early and formally recognized.

**Note:** The pairing of instruments — string and wind — suggests a **structured musical culture**, not random or primitive noise.

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- The **Cainite line** is often painted as wholly degenerate, but here it produces **beauty and creative culture**.
    

> This reinforces the idea that divine image-bearers retain **creative authority** — even outside the chosen lineage.

- Later church traditions often attributed music's origin to heavenly beings or temple worship, ignoring its **pre-Flood human roots**.

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Anno Mundi ~330–350**

This follows Yaval’s tent-dwelling livestock development. Yuval’s musical culture likely **arose concurrently** in a **settled, urban Cainite context**, possibly as a means of ceremony, entertainment, or cultic practice.

---

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And his brother’s name was Jubal: he was the father of all such as handle the harp and organ.”

**YLT:**  
“And the name of his brother is Jubal, he hath been father of every one handling harp and organ.”

**NIV:**  
“His brother’s name was Jubal; he was the father of all who play stringed instruments and pipes.”

> “Organ” (KJV/YLT) is an anachronistic translation — no connection to pipe organs. “Pipes” (NIV) is more accurate for _ugav_.

---

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

**Jubilees 4:21** — explicitly describes Yuval as the inventor of music, string, and wind instruments.

**1 Samuel 10:5** — early prophets accompanied by harp and pipe; echoes of _Yuval’s legacy_.

**Revelation 5:8** — heavenly harps symbolizing worship — prefigured by human musical development.
