### **GENESIS 4:5**

_Scroll of Adam_

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**But upon Qayin and his offering He did not look with favor; and Qayin burned exceedingly with anger, and his face fell.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וְאֶל־קַיִן וְאֶל־מִנְחָתוֹ לֹא שָׁעָה  
וַיִּחַר לְקַיִן מְאֹד  
וַיִּפְּלוּ פָּנָיו

---

#### Transliteration:

_Ve’el-Qayin ve’el-minchato lo sha’ah;  
vayyichar le’Qayin me’od,  
vayyiplu panav._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“But Cain and his sacrifices He regarded not, and Cain was exceedingly sorrowful, and his countenance fell.”

_LXX softens “anger” into “sorrow,” possibly reflecting theological discomfort with divine rejection._

---

#### DSS (4QGen-Exoda):

Confirms MT: strong use of _vayyichar_ (burned with anger) and _panav_ (his face), affirming emotional intensity. No textual deviation.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“Did not look with favor” (לֹא שָׁעָה)**

- _Lo sha’ah_ = “did not regard,” “did not turn toward” — the opposite of verse 4.
    
- The rejection is of **both the man and the minchah**, not just the gift.
    
- Implies Cain’s inner disposition was **misaligned with divine expectation** (cf. 1 John 3:12).
    

**“Cain burned with anger” (וַיִּחַר לְקַיִן מְאֹד)**

- _Vayyichar_ = literally “he burned,” commonly used for **rage or divine wrath** (e.g., Exod 32:19).
    
- _Me’od_ = exceedingly — intensifier indicating **raging fury**, not just disappointment.
    
- First recorded instance of human **emotional rebellion against God**.
    

**“And his face fell” (וַיִּפְּלוּ פָּנָיו)**

- A Hebrew idiom for **dejection, shame, or sullen resentment**.
    
- Contrasts with the **uplifted face** of blessing (cf. Num 6:26).
    
- Marks the beginning of **spiritual deterioration** that leads to violence.
    

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Some translations (like LXX) downplay Cain’s **anger** as “sorrow,” softening the severity of rejection.
    
- Modern theology often blames God’s preference for a blood offering — but the **text clearly centers on Cain’s attitude**, not offering type (cf. Heb 11:4, Jude 11).

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Anno Mundi ~100-125**, same general timeframe as the offering event — possibly the same day or shortly thereafter.

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell.”

**YLT:**  
“And unto Cain and unto his present He looked not; and it is very displeasing to Cain, and his countenance is fallen.”

**NIV:**  
“But on Cain and his offering he did not look with favor. So Cain was very angry, and his face was downcast.”

_KJV and NIV preserve the emotional progression of **rejection → rage → despair**. YLT and LXX soften the tone slightly._

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

**Jude 11** — “the way of Cain” is the **archetype of self-righteousness and rebellion**.

**1 John 3:12** — Cain’s works were “evil” while Abel’s were righteous, implying deeper heart motives than the offering alone.

**Jubilees 4:5–6** — recounts Cain’s rage and growing resentment, leading to plotting Abel’s death.
