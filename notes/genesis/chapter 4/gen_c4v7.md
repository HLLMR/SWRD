### **GENESIS 4:7**

_Scroll of Adam_

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**“If you do well, will you not be lifted up? But if you do not do well, sin is crouching at the door; and its desire is for you, but you must rule over it.”**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

הֲלוֹא אִם־תֵּיטִיב  
שְׂאֵת  
וְאִם לֹא תֵיטִיב  
לַפֶּתַח חַטָּאת רֹבֵץ  
וְאֵלֶיךָ תְּשׁוּקָתוֹ  
וְאַתָּה תִּמְשָׁל־בּוֹ

---

#### Transliteration:

_Halo im-teitiv  
se’et;  
ve’im lo teitiv  
lapetach chatta’t rovetz,  
ve’eilekha teshukato,  
ve’atah timshal-bo._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“Have you not sinned if you have brought it rightly, but not rightly divided it? Be still; to you shall be his submission, and you shall rule over him.”

_The LXX departs significantly from the MT here, interpreting Cain’s sin as offering incorrectly and mistranslating the “sin crouching” metaphor._

---

#### DSS (4QGen-Exoda):

Strong support for MT phrasing — confirms **“sin is crouching,”** and **“its desire is for you”** — firmly establishing the personified warning of sin.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“If you do well, will you not be lifted up?” (שְׂאֵת)**

- _Se’et_ = uplifted, accepted, restored.
    
- This is **mercy in action** — God offers Cain a **path back to favor**.
    
- **Contrast** with fallen face in v.6 — the face can be lifted again through righteousness.
    

**“Sin is crouching at the door” (חַטָּאת רֹבֵץ)**

- _Chatta’t_ = sin, here depicted as a **predatory animal**, waiting to pounce.
    
- _Rovetz_ = “lying in wait,” like a **lion or wild beast** (cf. Gen 49:9).
    
- First appearance of **sin as an external force**, but one with internal access — extremely advanced theological concept for early Scripture.
    

**“Its desire is for you, but you must rule over it” (וְאֵלֶיךָ תְּשׁוּקָתוֹ...)**

- _Teshukah_ = longing, desire, craving — used again in **Gen 3:16** for woman’s desire for husband, implying a relational struggle.
    
- **Sin desires to master Cain**, but he is told to **master it** — personal responsibility in the face of spiritual temptation.

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- LXX radically changes the meaning, turning this into a commentary on **incorrect ritual procedure**, missing the profound **spiritual warfare imagery**.
    
- Many Christian teachings reduce this to a moral lesson, overlooking the **proto-spiritual anthropology**: sin as a **living predator**, and man’s ability to overcome it through choice.
    
- Some traditions use this to support **original sin doctrines**, but this passage asserts Cain had **freedom to choose**.

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Anno Mundi ~100-125**, moments after the rejected offering — Cain is still standing **at the threshold**, but teetering toward rebellion.

---

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto thee shall be his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.”

**YLT:**  
“Is there not, if thou dost well, acceptance? and if thou dost not well, at the opening a sin-offering is crouching, and unto thee its desire, and thou rulest over it.”

**NIV:**  
“If you do what is right, will you not be accepted? But if you do not do what is right, sin is crouching at your door; it desires to have you, but you must rule over it.”

_NIV and KJV stay close to the Hebrew’s intent. YLT makes the error of reading _chatta’t_ as “sin-offering,” which distorts the image._

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

**Romans 6:12–14** — Paul’s teaching that sin shall not rule over the believer echoes this exact tension.

**Jubilees 4:6–7** — depicts this warning and Cain’s failure to heed it.

**Sirach 15:14–17 (deutero)** — “God made man from the beginning, and left him in the hand of his own counsel” — a powerful parallel to Cain’s choice here.
