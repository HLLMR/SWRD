### **GENESIS 4:16**

_Scroll of Adam_

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And Qayin went out from the presence of YHWH, and he dwelt in the land of Nod, east of Eden.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וַיֵּצֵא קַיִן מִלִּפְנֵי יְהוָה  
וַיֵּשֶׁב בְּאֶרֶץ נוֹד  
קִדְמַת־עֵדֶן

---

#### Transliteration:

_Vayetze Qayin milifnei YHWH,  
vayeshev b’eretz Nod,  
kidmat-ʿEden._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And Cain went out from the presence of God, and dwelt in the land of Nod over against Eden.”

_“Over against Eden” in the LXX reflects “east of Eden” — a relative geographic separation._

---

#### DSS (4QGen-Exoda):

Fully aligns with MT. “Presence of YHWH” and “land of Nod” are retained as in MT. No deviation.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“Went out from the presence of YHWH” (מִלִּפְנֵי יְהוָה)**

- _Milifnei_ = “from before the face of” — a strong idiom for **covenantal exclusion**.
    
- Not merely geographic — signifies **estrangement from divine fellowship**.
    

**“Dwelt in the land of Nod” (בְּאֶרֶץ נוֹד)**

- _Nod_ (נוֹד) is from the same root as _nad_ — to wander, flee, be unsettled.
    
- Thus: “Land of Wandering.” Not a fixed place, but an **ironic fulfillment** of Cain’s curse.
    

> He dwells in “wandering” — an oxymoron. Cain becomes the founder of **post-Edenic civilization**, built from exile.

**“East of Eden” (קִדְמַת־עֵדֶן)**

- _Kidmat_ = “toward the front,” or “east of.”
    
- Repetition of **eastward movement** (cf. Gen 3:24 — cherubim placed east of Eden).
    
- Exile moves **away from Eden’s holiness** — a theme echoed in the scattering at Babel and the fate of Lot.
    

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- The **geography of Eden and Nod** is often mythologized or allegorized. But Genesis treats these as **real locations**, anchored in early human geography.
    
- Traditional interpretations rarely emphasize the **foundational split** here — Cain becomes the father of a **parallel lineage and civilization**, distinct from the Sethite line.

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Anno Mundi ~128–130**

This event marks the **culmination of Cain’s exile**, and precedes the founding of his city (v.17) and the birth of Seth (v.25). Cain's removal from Edenic proximity becomes permanent.

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And Cain went out from the presence of the Lord, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.”

**YLT:**  
“And Cain goeth out from before Jehovah, and dwelleth in the land, moving about east of Eden.”

**NIV:**  
“So Cain went out from the Lord’s presence and lived in the land of Nod, east of Eden.”

_All major translations preserve the core structure and meaning, though only YLT hints at the wandering implied by the name “Nod.”_

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

**Jubilees 4:15–17** — states Cain settled far from Eden and built a city; identifies his wife as his sister Awan.

**1 Enoch 22** — references wanderers and the disinherited — indirect echoes of Cain’s fate.

**Psalm 139:7** — “Where can I flee from Your presence?” — contrasts Cain’s departure with the Psalmist’s longing for God.
