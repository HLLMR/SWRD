### **GENESIS 4:15**

_Scroll of Adam_

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And YHWH said to him, “Therefore, whoever slays Qayin, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold.” And YHWH set a sign upon Qayin, lest anyone finding him should strike him.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וַיֹּאמֶר יְהוָה לוֹ  
לָכֵן כָּל־הֹרֵג קַיִן  
שִׁבְעָתַיִם יֻקָּם  
וַיָּשֶׂם יְהוָה לְקַיִן אוֹת  
לְבִלְתִּי הַכּוֹת־אֹתוֹ כָּל־מֹצְאוֹ

---

#### Transliteration:

_Vayomer YHWH lo,  
lachen kol-horeg Qayin,  
shiv’atayim yukkam.  
Vayasem YHWH le’Qayin ot,  
levilti hakot oto kol-motz’o._

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And the Lord God said to him, ‘Not so, anyone that slays Cain shall suffer sevenfold vengeance.’ And the Lord God set a mark upon Cain, that no one who found him might slay him.”

_LXX affirms divine protection, though slightly rephrased: “not so” instead of “therefore.”_

---

#### DSS (4QGen-Exoda):

Fully aligns with the MT; confirms key phrases: _“sevenfold vengeance,” “sign upon Cain,”_ and _“lest anyone finding him should strike him.”_

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“Whoever slays Cain, vengeance shall be taken sevenfold” (שִׁבְעָתַיִם יֻקָּם)**

- _Shiv’atayim_ = “sevenfold” — covenantal idiom for **intensified judgment**.
    
- This is **not a pardon** for Cain — it's a protective boundary on further violence.
    
- Parallels Gen 9:6 — divine monopoly on justice.
    

> YHWH is not affirming Cain's righteousness — He is **containing vengeance** to preserve early humanity from blood-feud cycles.

**“And YHWH set a sign upon Cain” (וַיָּשֶׂם יְהוָה לְקַיִן אוֹת)**

- _Ot_ (אוֹת) = sign, token, distinguishing mark — same word used in:
    
    - Gen 9:13 (rainbow),
        
    - Exo 12:13 (blood on doorposts),
        
    - Ezek 9:4 (mark of preservation).
        
- The sign may have been **visible, symbolic, or spiritual** — purpose is explicit: _“lest anyone strike him.”_
    

**“Lest anyone finding him should strike him” (לְבִלְתִּי הַכּוֹת אֹתוֹ)**

- Reinforces the idea that **others exist** — potentially other children of Adam.

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Traditional readings sometimes treat this as **God’s mercy** on Cain — yet the text emphasizes **containment of vengeance**, not absolution.
    
- The “Mark of Cain” has been heavily allegorized (and abused in racial contexts) — the **Hebrew text never describes the sign’s appearance**, and any physical/racial speculation is unbiblical.

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Anno Mundi ~127–129**

Cain’s curse, complaint, and divine response unfold over a very short period after Abel’s murder. This verse concludes the judgment cycle just prior to Seth’s birth at AM 130.

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And the Lord said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And the Lord set a mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him.”

**YLT:**  
“And Jehovah saith to him, ‘Therefore—of any slayer of Cain sevenfold it is required;’ and Jehovah setteth to Cain a token, that none finding him doth slay him.”

**NIV:**  
“But the Lord said to him, ‘Not so; anyone who kills Cain will suffer vengeance seven times over.’ Then the Lord put a mark on Cain so that no one who found him would kill him.”

_NIV smooths out the structure and renders “therefore” as “not so,” matching the LXX. KJV and YLT preserve the judicial tone better._

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

**Jubilees 4:14–15** — affirms that Cain is marked to prevent retribution from Abel’s brothers.

**Deuteronomy 32:35** — “Vengeance is Mine, I will repay” — anticipates divine control over retributive justice.

**Revelation 7:3–4** — parallels the sealing of God’s people with a protective mark.
