### **GENESIS 4:8**

_Scroll of Adam_

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And Qayin spoke to Havel his brother. And it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Qayin rose up against Havel his brother and killed him.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וַיֹּאמֶר קַיִן אֶל־הֶבֶל אָחִיו  
וַיְהִי בִּהְיוֹתָם בַּשָּׂדֶה  
וַיָּקָם קַיִן אֶל־הֶבֶל אָחִיו  
וַיַּהַרְגֵהוּ

---

#### Transliteration:

_Vayyomer Qayin el-Havel achiv;  
vayehi bihyotam ba’sadeh;  
vayyaqam Qayin el-Havel achiv,  
vayyahargeihu._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And Cain said to Abel his brother, ‘Let us go out into the field.’ And it came to pass when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him.”

_The LXX includes a fuller speech: “Let us go out into the field,” which is **absent in MT and DSS**._

---

#### DSS (4QGen-Exoda):

Agrees with MT — **no recorded speech** of Cain to Abel. The line “Let us go out into the field” appears to be a **later insertion** from early Greek traditions or oral elaboration.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“And Qayin spoke to Havel his brother” (וַיֹּאמֶר קַיִן אֶל־הֶבֶל אָחִיו)**

- The sentence is **incomplete in MT** — no speech follows. Many scholars believe this is a **textual ellipsis**, suggesting **intended ambiguity**.
    
- This may reflect **premeditation** or **internalized conflict**, leaving the reader suspended in tension before the murder occurs.
    

**“When they were in the field” (בַּשָּׂדֶה)**

- _Sadeh_ = cultivated or open land, not wilderness. Symbolic of the **fallen human domain** post-Eden.
    
- In Jubilees and Jasher, this is the location where sacrifices occurred — suggesting this may have been **a return to the altar site**.
    

**“Cain rose up... and killed him” (וַיָּקָם... וַיַּהַרְגֵהוּ)**

- _Vayyaqam_ = rose up — emphasizes sudden violence.
    
- _Vayyahargeihu_ = killed him — the same root later used for **murder or unlawful slaying** (cf. Exod 20:13).
    

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- The LXX’s added speech (“Let us go out…”) is **not attested in the Hebrew witnesses**, yet it has **shaped homiletics and dramatic retellings**.
    
- Some traditions soften Cain’s crime into jealousy or hurt feelings — but the Scripture emphasizes **intentional, unprovoked fratricide** following divine warning.

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Anno Mundi ~125-129**  
This is likely within a decade or two of the offerings, once Cain’s **bitterness has festered** and his decision to act is finalized.

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him.”

**YLT:**  
“And Cain saith unto Abel his brother… and it cometh to pass in their being in the field, that Cain riseth up against Abel his brother, and slayeth him.”

**NIV:**  
“Now Cain said to his brother Abel, ‘Let’s go out to the field.’ While they were in the field, Cain attacked his brother Abel and killed him.”

_KJV and YLT correctly note the **absence of speech content**. NIV follows the **LXX addition**, which is not found in MT or DSS._

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

**Jubilees 4:8–9** — Cain plotted against Abel and rose up at the place of their sacrifice.

**Book of Jasher 1:19–20** — depicts Cain striking Abel with a stone in a field dispute; they argue, and Cain kills him out of **envy and possession conflict**.

**1 John 3:12** — “Cain… murdered his brother. And why? Because his works were evil and his brother’s righteous.”
