### **GENESIS 4:18**

_Scroll of Adam_

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And to Chanokh was born Irad. And Irad fathered Mechuyael. And Mechuyael fathered Metushael. And Metushael fathered Lamekh.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וַיִּוָּלֵד לַחֲנוֹךְ אִירָד  
וְעִירָד יָלַד אֶת־מְחוּיָאֵל  
וּמְחוּיָאֵל יָלַד אֶת־מְתוּשָׁאֵל  
וּמְתוּשָׁאֵל יָלַד אֶת־לֶמֶךְ

---

#### Transliteration:

_Vayyivaled la-Chanokh Irad,  
ve-Irad yalad et-Mechuyael,  
u-Mechuyael yalad et-Metushael,  
u-Metushael yalad et-Lamekh._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And to Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begot Maeel: and Maeel begot Methuselah: and Methuselah begot Lamech.”

> The LXX alters several names, possibly by scribal corruption or confusion with the Sethite genealogy in Genesis 5.

---

#### DSS (4QGen-Exoda):

Follows MT. Names match Masoretic spellings, confirming the **Cainite genealogy** is distinct from Seth’s line in Gen 5.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**Genealogy Overview:**  
This verse lays out **four generations** descending from Cain through Chanokh:

1. **Irad** (עִירָד) — possibly derived from “city” (עִיר) or “fugitive” root; a name reflecting exile?
    
2. **Mechuyael** (מְחוּיָאֵל) — name meaning unclear, but likely contains “El” (God) as suffix.
    
3. **Metushael** (מְתוּשָׁאֵל) — similar to Methuselah in Seth’s line, but not identical.
    
4. **Lamekh** (לֶמֶךְ) — becomes the most prominent descendant; described in detail in the next verses.
    

> These names form the **Cainite lineage**, a separate and parallel genealogy to the line of Seth (Gen 5). The names are often confused due to phonetic similarity but should not be conflated.

**Parallelism with Sethite Line:**

- Both lines include names like **Chanokh/Enoch** and **Lamekh**, which leads to critical confusion by higher critics.
    
- These **mirror names** may reflect **branching legacy, rivalry, or parallel destinies**, but they are not duplicates.
    

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Liberal scholarship uses the similar names in Gen 4 and Gen 5 to argue for source conflation (e.g., J and P source theories).
    
- This undermines the integrity of the text as **intentional parallel genealogies** — one from Cain, the other from Seth.
    

> But the text presents these lines **in sequence**, not in contradiction. The Cainite line ends before the Flood; Seth’s line continues through Noah.

---

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Anno Mundi ~130–250**

This genealogy likely spans 120+ years, from shortly after Cain’s exile through to Lamekh’s adulthood. These dates are approximate, but consistent with rapid population expansion and early lifespans.

---

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and Mehujael begat Methusael: and Methusael begat Lamech.”

**YLT:**  
“And born to Enoch is Irad; and Irad hath begotten Mehujael; and Mehujael hath begotten Methusael; and Methusael hath begotten Lamech.”

**NIV:**  
“To Enoch was born Irad, and Irad was the father of Mehujael, and Mehujael was the father of Methushael, and Methushael was the father of Lamech.”

_All versions align closely with the MT here. The LXX is the only one to diverge, particularly on name forms._

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

**Jubilees 4:13–15** — confirms some of these names and traces Cain’s descendants, but focuses mostly on Seth’s line after Lamekh.

**Genesis 5** — Sethite genealogy begins, offering a point of **contrast** to this Cainite line.

**1 Enoch** — does not cover Cain’s line directly but thematically reflects the split between righteous and corrupted offspring.
