_Scroll of Adam_

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And Lamekh took for himself two wives: the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the second was Tzillah.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וַיִּקַּח לוֹ לֶמֶךְ שְׁתֵּי נָשִׁים  
שֵׁם הָאַחַת עָדָה  
וְשֵׁם הַשֵּׁנִי צִלָּה

---

#### Transliteration:

_Vayyiqqach lo Lamekh shtei nashim;  
shem ha’achath Adah,  
veshem ha’sheni Tzillah._

_The LXX maintains the structure but slightly modifies the names to fit Greek phonology._

Fully aligns with MT; no deviations in name forms or phrasing.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“Lamekh took for himself two wives…”**

- First mention of **polygamy** in Scripture.
    
- Verb structure implies a **deliberate act** — not cultural norm, but personal initiative.
    
- Cain’s line now begins to **redefine family structure** apart from Edenic monogamy (cf. Gen 2:24).
    

> This is not condemned here directly — but the narrative contrast with Adam and Havvah sets the moral baseline.

**“Adah” (עָדָה)**

- Root meaning: “ornament,” “adornment,” or “beauty.”
    
- Symbolic of **external appeal**, possibly prestige.
    

**“Tzillah” (צִלָּה)**

- Root meaning: “shade,” “protection,” or “shadow.”
    
- May imply a **softer**, more nurturing figure — or possibly **hidden strength**.
    

> These names are personal and poetic — possibly indicating **status roles** in early polygamous society.

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Polygamy is often sanitized or justified in biblical history, but its **first appearance comes through the cursed Cainite line**, not the righteous.
    
- Later patriarchs (Abraham, Jacob, David) take multiple wives, but this **first polygamist** stands outside God’s Edenic order.
    

> Early rabbinic and later Christian commentary often sidesteps this by emphasizing tribal or legal context — but **Genesis frames polygamy as cultural innovation**, not divine instruction.

---

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Anno Mundi ~250–300**

Lamekh is likely in midlife or later here. The Cainite line is entering cultural maturity — cities, family branches, and social institutions are forming.

---

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.”

**YLT:**  
“And Lamech taketh to himself two wives, the name of the one is Adah, and the name of the second Zillah.”

**NIV:**  
“Lamech married two women, one named Adah and the other Zillah.”

_NIV modernizes the language and drops the personal agency of “took to himself,” which is important to preserve._

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

**Jubilees 4:14–22** — confirms the names Adah and Tzillah, and expands on their children and roles in early society.

**Genesis 2:24** — Edenic standard of one man, one wife becomes the **contrast point** here.

**1 Timothy 3:2** — echoes monogamous ideal for leadership: “husband of one wife.”
