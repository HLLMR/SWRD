### **GENESIS 4:10**

_Scroll of Adam_

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And He said, “What have you done? The voice of your brother’s blood cries out to Me from the ground.”**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וַיֹּאמֶר  
מֶה עָשִׂיתָ  
קוֹל דְּמֵי אָחִיךָ צֹעֲקִים אֵלַי מִן־הָאֲדָמָה

---

#### Transliteration:

_Vayyomer,  
meh asita?  
qol d’mei achikha tzo’aqim elai min-ha’adamah._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And the Lord said, ‘What have you done? The voice of your brother’s blood cries to Me out of the ground.’”

_LXX follows MT exactly in both phrasing and structure._

---

#### DSS (4QGen-Exoda):

Fully supports MT wording — confirms **“voice of your brother’s blood”** and its cry **“from the ground.”**

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“What have you done?” (מֶה עָשִׂיתָ)**

- Repeats the divine pattern of confrontation, just as with Eve in Gen 3:13.
    
- Not merely rhetorical — meant to evoke conviction and **accountability**.
    

**“Voice of your brother’s blood” (קוֹל דְּמֵי אָחִיךָ)**

- _Qol d’mei_ = voice of bloods — plural in Hebrew (**דְּמֵי**, _d’mei_).
    
- Rabbinic tradition interprets this as:
    
    - Abel’s blood,
        
    - The **potential generations** extinguished in the murder,
        
    - Or a legal echo: multiple cries for **justice**.
        

**“Cries out to Me from the ground” (צֹעֲקִים אֵלַי מִן־הָאֲדָמָה)**

- _Tzo’aqim_ = cries out with anguish — same root used for Israel’s cry in Egypt (Exod 3:7).
    
- The ground becomes a **witness and courtroom**, reflecting the seriousness of innocent bloodshed.
    

> Compare with Gen 3:17 — the ground was cursed for Adam’s sin. Now it is **defiled by blood**, escalating the curse.

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- The plural “bloods” is **often flattened** in translation, losing the deep implication of **future generations cut off**.
    
- Some traditions ignore the **forensic or legal weight** of this verse — but it clearly establishes the principle of **divine justice on spilled blood**.

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Anno Mundi ~125-129**, directly following Cain’s evasion. This marks the divine **verdict moment** — God has not only seen, but **heard** the testimony of the slain.

---

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother’s blood crieth unto me from the ground.”

**YLT:**  
“And He saith, ‘What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother’s blood is crying unto Me from the ground.’”

**NIV:**  
“The Lord said, ‘What have you done? Listen! Your brother’s blood cries out to Me from the ground.’”

_NIV adds “Listen!” to dramatize it, though it’s not present in MT. KJV captures the poetic tone, but misses plural “bloods.”_

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

**Hebrews 12:24** — contrasts the “blood of sprinkling” (Yeshua) with the **blood of Abel**, which cried out for vengeance.

**Jubilees 4:11** — depicts the ground rejecting Abel’s body and “opening not its mouth,” symbolizing **cosmic offense** at murder.

**Numbers 35:33** — “Blood pollutes the land, and no atonement can be made… except by the blood of the one who shed it.”
