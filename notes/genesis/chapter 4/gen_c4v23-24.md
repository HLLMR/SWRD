### **GENESIS 4:23–24**

_Scroll of Adam_

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And Lamekh said to his wives, Adah and Tzillah:  
“Hear my voice, wives of Lamekh;  
give ear to my saying:  
For I have slain a man for wounding me,  
and a young man for bruising me.  
If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold,  
then Lamekh seventy and sevenfold.”**

#### Hebrew (MT):

וַיֹּאמֶר לֶמֶךְ לְנָשָׁיו עָדָה וְצִלָּה  
שְׁמַעַן קוֹלִי נְשֵׁי לָמֶךְ  
הַאֲזֵנָּה אִמְרָתִי  
כִּי אִישׁ הָרַגְתִּי לְפִצְעִי  
וְיֶלֶד לְחַבֻּרָתִי  
כִּי שִׁבְעָתַיִם יֻקַּם קָיִן  
וְלֶמֶךְ שִׁבְעִים וְשִׁבְעָה

#### Transliteration:

_Vayomer Lamekh le’nashav Adah ve’Tzillah:  
Shemaʿan qoli, n’shei Lamekh;  
ha’azenah imrati.  
Ki ish haragti le’fitzi,  
veyeled le’chabburati.  
Ki shivʿatayim yuqqam Qayin,  
ve’Lamekh shivʿim ve’shivʿah._

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And Lamech said to his wives Ada and Sella,  
Hear my voice, ye wives of Lamech,  
consider my words,  
because I have slain a man to my sorrow,  
and a youth to my grief.  
Because vengeance has been exacted seven times on Cain’s behalf,  
on Lamech it shall be seventy times seven.”

> Note: LXX seems to present the poem as a **lamentation**, rather than a boast. This softens the tone compared to the MT.

#### DSS (4QGen-Exoda):

Supports the poetic structure and phrasing of the MT. Confirms this is an early and intentionally stylized unit — perhaps a song, chant, or oath.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“I have slain a man… a young man…”**

- Hebrew _ish_ (man) and _yeled_ (youth/boy) suggest **two possible victims**, though some interpret this as **parallelism**.
    
- The verbs _haragti_ (I have killed) and the paired reasons — wounding, bruising — suggest a **reactionary act**, possibly of vengeance or defense.
    
- Some scholars take this as a **warning**, others as **confession**, still others as **boasting of escalated vengeance**.
    

**“Seventy and sevenfold” (שִׁבְעִים וְשִׁבְעָה)**

- Clear escalation from God’s protection of Cain (sevenfold) in Gen 4:15.
    
- Could be:
    
    - **A claim of divine protection** greater than Cain’s.
        
    - **An arrogant declaration** of disproportionate retaliation.
        
    - **A prophetic foreshadowing** of vengeance run rampant in Cain’s line.
        

> Later paralleled by **Yeshua’s command** in Matthew 18:22: _“Not seven times, but seventy times seven”_ — reversing vengeance into **forgiveness**.

**Literary Form:**

- Hebrew meter and repetition suggest this was **a formalized speech** — possibly **the world’s first poem**.
    
- Directed at his wives, as if to justify or announce something grave.

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Many traditions avoid the **dark moral decay** presented here — a man with multiple wives, boasting (or lamenting) murder, and elevating vengeance to mythic levels.
    
- Some traditions treat this as **myth or fiction**, but the Hebrew text presents Lamekh’s words with poetic precision and historical realism.
    

> A possible parallel to **Genesis 6:11**, where “the earth was filled with violence.”

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Anno Mundi ~400–420**

This appears late in Lamekh’s life, perhaps a pivotal turning point before the rise of Seth’s lineage and the eventual corruption that leads to the Flood.

---

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“…for I have slain a man to my wounding, and a young man to my hurt…”

**YLT:**  
“…For a man I have slain for my wound, and a young man for my hurt…”

**NIV:**  
“I have killed a man for wounding me, a young man for injuring me.”

> NIV and KJV capture the structure well, but all three soften the poetic _parallel escalation_ that the Hebrew hints at.

---

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

**1 Enoch 8–10** — context of **moral degeneration** before the Flood; echoes Lamekh’s defiance.

**Matthew 18:22** — inverse of this concept: divine mercy outpacing vengeance.

**Revelation 18:6–8** — Babylon judged **double** for her sins — thematic continuation of **escalated consequence**.
