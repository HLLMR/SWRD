### **GENESIS 4:3**

_Scroll of Adam_

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And it came to pass, at the end of days, that Qayin brought of the fruit of the ground an offering to YHWH.**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וַיְהִי מִקֵּץ יָמִים  
וַיָּבֵא קַיִן מִפְּרִי הָאֲדָמָה  
מִנְחָה לַיהוָה

---

#### Transliteration:

_Vayehi miqqets yamim  
vayyave Qayin miperi ha’adamah  
minchah la’YHWH._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And it was so after some time that Cain brought of the fruits of the earth a sacrifice to the Lord.”

_“Sacrifice” here translates _minchah_, though technically that refers to a **gift or grain offering**, not blood sacrifice._

---

#### DSS (4QGen-Exoda):

Aligns with MT: confirms use of _minchah_ and _miqqets yamim_ — no textual variants noted.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“At the end of days” (מִקֵּץ יָמִים)**

- _Miqqets yamim_ = “after a period of days,” likely indicating **a designated festival time** or completion of an agricultural cycle.
    
- Phrase also used in **Daniel 8:17** and elsewhere to signify **completion of a season or appointed time** — not just random passage of time.
    

**“Cain brought of the fruit of the ground”**

- He offers what he grows — an appropriate category for a _minchah_, which can include **grain, oil, or produce**.
    
- But there’s **no mention of firstfruits or best** — this may hint at **mediocrity or lack of reverence**, especially in contrast with Abel’s offering.
    

**“Minchah to YHWH” (מִנְחָה לַיהוָה)**

- _Minchah_ is used in Leviticus to refer to **non-bloody offerings**, often voluntary gifts.
    
- It can be righteous when given with the **right heart** (cf. Gen 32:13, Exod 29:41) — but here, context implies Cain’s was **not accepted** (next verse).
    

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- Mainstream interpretations often assume Cain’s offering was rejected **because it wasn’t blood**, but the text does **not say this**.
    
- The issue lies more in **attitude and intent** than in form. God accepts _minchah_ elsewhere when rightly offered (Lev 2, Num 15).
    
- Catholic and Reformed traditions sometimes weaponize this story to argue blood atonement was required pre-Law — a point **not supported by this passage alone**.

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Anno Mundi ~100-125**  
Enough time has passed for Cain and Abel to cultivate livelihoods, mature, and participate in **seasonal offerings** — possibly the first **feast-cycle** moment post-Eden.

---

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the Lord.”

**YLT:**  
“And it cometh to pass at the end of days that Cain bringeth from the fruit of the ground a present to Jehovah;”

**NIV:**  
“In the course of time Cain brought some of the fruits of the soil as an offering to the Lord.”

_NIV’s “some of the fruits” emphasizes ordinariness. KJV and YLT retain neutrality. Only YLT preserves “end of days” directly._

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

**Jubilees 4:3–5** — says Cain and Abel were instructed by Adam to offer sacrifices. Cain is described as offering “bad fruit,” while Abel gives the firstborn of his flock.

**Hebrews 11:4** — “By faith Abel offered a more excellent sacrifice than Cain,” indicating that the heart posture, not substance alone, was decisive.

**1 John 3:12** — explicitly connects Cain’s evil deeds with his offering, reinforcing that **motivation** was the key issue.
