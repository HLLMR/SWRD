### **GENESIS 4:13**

_Scroll of Adam_

---

#### 📜 Literal Translation (Masoretic Text, Cross-referenced with LXX and DSS):

**And Qayin said to YHWH, “My punishment is too great to bear.”**

---

#### Hebrew (MT):

וַיֹּאמֶר קַיִן אֶל־יְהוָה  
גָּדוֹל עֲוֺנִי מִנְּשֹׂא

---

#### Transliteration:

_Vayyomer Qayin el-YHWH,  
gadol avoni min-neso._

---

#### LXX (Brenton):

“And Cain said to the Lord God, ‘My crime is too great for me to be forgiven.’”

_The LXX differs slightly — translating “avon” (עָוֺן) as **crime**, and **adds forgiveness** rather than “bear.”_

---

#### DSS (4QGen-Exoda):

Matches MT exactly — supports “my iniquity is too great to bear” rendering.

### ⚔️ Critical Analysis:

**“Gadol avoni min-neso” (גָּדוֹל עֲוֺנִי מִנְּשֹׂא)**

- _Avon_ (עָוֺן) = guilt, iniquity, or punishment — **ambiguous by design**.
    
- _Neso_ (נְּשֹׂא) = to bear, carry, lift up.
    
- Phrase can mean:
    
    1. **“My guilt is too great to be lifted”** (forgiven),
        
    2. **“My punishment is too heavy to bear.”**
        

> The ambiguity reflects Cain’s **emotional complexity** — is he lamenting judgment, or seeking pity?

---

### ⚠️ Institutional Obfuscation:

- LXX and many modern translations interpret this verse **as a plea for forgiveness**, softening Cain’s guilt.
    
- However, MT retains tension — Cain **does not confess or repent**; he reacts to consequences, not to the sin itself.
    

> His grief is **self-focused**, not penitential — a model of false sorrow (cf. 2 Corinthians 7:10).

---

### 🕰️ AM Estimate:

**Anno Mundi ~125-129**, immediately following his curse. This marks the **first recorded human appeal to divine justice**, but without true repentance.

---

### 📖 Comparison:

**KJV:**  
“And Cain said unto the Lord, My punishment is greater than I can bear.”

**YLT:**  
“And Cain saith unto Jehovah, ‘Greater is my punishment than to be borne;’”

**NIV:**  
“Cain said to the Lord, ‘My punishment is more than I can bear.’”

_All major versions follow MT’s “punishment” rendering, but none preserve the **dual-meaning** of the word “avon.”_

### 🔗 Interleaving Opportunities:

**Psalm 38:4** — “My iniquities are gone over my head: as a heavy burden they are too heavy for me.”

**Proverbs 28:13** — “He who covers his sins will not prosper, but whoever confesses and forsakes them shall find mercy.” Cain does not confess.

**Jubilees 4:13–14** — adds that Cain feared being killed, prompting YHWH’s mark as protection — this aligns with the next verse in Genesis.
