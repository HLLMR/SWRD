### 🔍 Key Takeaways for SWRD Commentary:

- **Genesis 2:1 (formerly 2:4)** serves as a **narrative break and re-focus** — not a timeline continuation. It resets the scene from cosmic to human-centric.
    
- **No contradiction** exists between the chapters — only different lenses.
    
- The move of 2:1–3 into the end of chapter 1 makes the break even more distinct, which helps reinforce the literary structure.
    
- **Adam's creation** is shown in technical and spiritual detail (formed + breath), whereas Genesis 1 describes it as a finished product.
    
- The **Garden of Eden** doesn’t even exist in Genesis 1 — it is a specifically prepared place for the man in Genesis 2.
