# SWRD: Sanctified Word, Restored Doctrine

Welcome to the **SWRD Project** – a chronological, restored canon translation project with interleaved apocrypha, anchored in the Textus Receptus and ancient Hebrew cosmology.

This vault is structured for Obsidian and version-controlled via Git.

## Structure
- `/books/` – Clean translations and hybrid interleaved books
- `/timeline/` – Chronology tools and year mapping
- `/calendar/` – Calendar reconstruction based on Enoch & Jubilees
- `/branding/` – Taglines, logos, and movement identity
