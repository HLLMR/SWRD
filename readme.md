# ⚔️ SWRD: The Word. Uncut.

### A Chronological Restoration of the Scriptures — Unabridged, Unafraid, Unfiltered

---

## 🔥 The Mission

The **Sanctified Word; Restored Doctrine (SWRD) Project** exists to restore, retranslate, and reorganize the entire body of divinely inspired Scripture — **canonical**, **apocryphal**, **pseudepigraphal**, and **dead-sea-authenticated** — into a single, **chronological, unmanipulated volume** that tells the true story of Earth, from **Creation to the Return of the King**.

This is not a new “Bible translation.”  
This is a resurrection. A rebellion. A reckoning.

We are unchaining the Word of YHWH from 2,000 years of compromise, corruption, and Catholic revisionism.

We are taking the Sword back.

## 🛡️ The Enemies of Truth

We reject:

- The **Roman Catholic Church**, its papal edicts, ecumenical councils, and Jesuit infiltrators.
    
- The **Westcott-Hort text** and all modern derivatives: NIV, RSV, NRSV, ESV, and their synthetic gospel.
    
- The lie of a **4.5 billion-year-old spinning globe**, and the godless cosmologies of NASA and Darwin.
    
- The modern Church, neutered by 501(c)(3) contracts and sermons that fear man more than YHWH.
    
- The erasure of Enoch, the silencing of Jubilees, the vanishing of Jasher, and the gnostic gaslighting of history.
    

If it contradicts the **Textus Receptus**, the **Masoretic Witness**, the **Dead Sea Scrolls**, and the **true words of the Messiah**, it gets cut. Period.

## 🧱 The Methodology

We build from the **ground up**, using a four-pillar foundation:

1. **Triple Witness Canon**
    
    - **Masoretic Text** (MT)
        
    - **Septuagint** (LXX)
        
    - **Dead Sea Scrolls** (DSS)
        
2. **Textus Receptus** (New Testament source), untouched by Jesuit hands.
    
3. **Anno Mundi Calendar**
    
    - Every book, verse, and event is placed on a **Biblical timeline**.
        
    - This is a chronological Bible — not thematic, not topical, **historical**.
        
4. **Evaluation of Non-Canonical Texts**
    
    - Books are included based on:
        
        - Consistency with Scripture
            
        - Historical alignment
            
        - Theological integrity
            
        - Divine fingerprints
            

We don’t just add missing books — we restore **context**.  
We don’t just correct verses — we rebuild **the flow of history**.

## 📜 What Makes SWRD Different?

- **Genesis to Revelation**, **Day 1 to Final Judgment** — no interruptions, no artificial divisions.
    
- **Antediluvian records**, including the Watchers, Nephilim, and the sons of Elohim, are front and center.
    
- The **Book of Enoch**, **Jubilees**, **Jasher**, and others are restored to their proper timeline.
    
- Each chapter is **freshly translated**, not paraphrased — using the **original Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek**, with no agenda.
    
- The finished product will be **open-source**, crowd-reviewed, and released in both **print** and **digital** formats.
