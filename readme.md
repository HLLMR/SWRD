# ⚔️ SWRD: The Word. Uncut.

### A Chronological Restoration of the Scriptures — Unabridged, Unafraid, Unfiltered

---

## 🔥 The Mission

The **Sanctified Word; Restored Doctrine (SWRD) Project** exists to restore, retranslate, and reorganize the entire body of divinely inspired Scripture — **canonical**, **apocryphal**, **pseudepigraphal**, and **dead-sea-authenticated** — into a single, **chronological, unmanipulated volume** that tells the true story of Earth, from **Creation to the Return of the King**.

This is not a new “Bible translation.”  
This is a resurrection. A rebellion. A reckoning.

We are unchaining the Word of YHWH from 2,000 years of compromise, corruption, and Catholic revisionism.

We are taking the Sword back.

## 🛡️ The Enemies of Truth

We reject:

- The **Roman Catholic Church**, its papal edicts, ecumenical councils, and Jesuit infiltrators.
    
- The **Westcott-Hort text** and all modern derivatives: NIV, RSV, NRSV, ESV, and their synthetic gospel.
    
- The lie of a **4.5 billion-year-old spinning globe**, and the godless cosmologies of NASA and Darwin.
    
- The modern Church, neutered by 501(c)(3) contracts and sermons that fear man more than YHWH.
    
- The erasure of Enoch, the silencing of Jubilees, the vanishing of Jasher, and the gnostic gaslighting of history.
    

If it contradicts the **Textus Receptus**, the **Masoretic Witness**, the **Dead Sea Scrolls**, and the **true words of the Messiah**, it gets cut. Period.

## 🧱 The Methodology

We build from the **ground up**, using a four-pillar foundation:

1. **Triple Witness Canon**
    
    - **Masoretic Text** (MT)
        
    - **Septuagint** (LXX)
        
    - **Dead Sea Scrolls** (DSS)
        
2. **Textus Receptus** (New Testament source), untouched by Jesuit hands.
    
3. **Anno Mundi Calendar**
    
    - Every book, verse, and event is placed on a **Biblical timeline**.
        
    - This is a chronological Bible — not thematic, not topical, **historical**.
        
4. **Evaluation of Non-Canonical Texts**
    
    - Books are included based on:
        
        - Consistency with Scripture
            
        - Historical alignment
            
        - Theological integrity
            
        - Divine fingerprints
            

We don’t just add missing books — we restore **context**.  
We don’t just correct verses — we rebuild **the flow of history**.

## 📜 What Makes SWRD Different?

- **Genesis to Revelation**, **Day 1 to Final Judgment** — no interruptions, no artificial divisions.
    
- **Antediluvian records**, including the Watchers, Nephilim, and the sons of Elohim, are front and center.
    
- The **Book of Enoch**, **Jubilees**, **Jasher**, and others are restored to their proper timeline.
    
- Each chapter is **freshly translated**, not paraphrased — using the **original Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek**, with no agenda.
    
- The finished product will be **open-source**, crowd-reviewed, and released in both **print** and **digital** formats.

## ⚠ A Warning

This project will offend the comfortable, confuse the indoctrinated, and terrify the gatekeepers.  
It will not be approved by seminaries, denominations, or mainstream theologians.  
That’s exactly how we’ll know it’s working.
