# SWRD: Sanctified Word, Restored Doctrine
## The Chronological Codex

Welcome to the **SWRD Project** – a chronological, restored canon translation project with interleaved apocrypha, anchored in the Textus Receptus and ancient Hebrew cosmology.

This vault is structured for Obsidian and version-controlled via Git.

## Structure
- `/translations/` – Clean, modern, literal translations from original Masoretic Hebrew & Textus Receptus manuscripts, validated against Dead Sea Scrolls
- `/timeline/` – Chronology tools and year mapping
- `/calendar/` – Calendar reconstruction based on Enoch & Jubilees
- `/branding/` – Taglines, logos, and movement identity
- `/notes/` - Contextual notes about translations & conflict resolutions
