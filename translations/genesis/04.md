## Chapter 4
### Qayin and Havel
#### 1  [gen\_c4v1](<../../notes/genesis/chapter 4/gen_c4v1.md>)
And the man knew Ḥavvah his wife, and she conceived and bore Qayin, and she said, “I have acquired a man with YHWH.”
#### 2  [gen\_c4v2](<../../notes/genesis/chapter 4/gen_c4v2.md>)
And she again bore his brother Havel. And Havel became a keeper of flocks, but Qayin was a tiller of the ground.
#### 3  [gen\_c4v3](<../../notes/genesis/chapter 4/gen_c4v3.md>)
And it came to pass, at the end of days, that Qayin brought of the fruit of the ground an offering to YHWH.
#### 4  [gen\_c4v4](<../../notes/genesis/chapter 4/gen_c4v4.md>)
And Havel also brought — from the firstborn of his flock, and from their fat portions. And YHWH looked with favor upon Havel and his offering.
#### 5  [gen\_c4v5](<../../notes/genesis/chapter 4/gen_c4v5.md>)
But upon Qayin and his offering He did not look with favor; and Qayin burned exceedingly with anger, and his face fell.
#### 6  [gen\_c4v6](<../../notes/genesis/chapter 4/gen_c4v6.md>)
And YHWH said to Qayin, “Why are you angry? And why has your face fallen?”
#### 7  [gen\_c4v7](<../../notes/genesis/chapter 4/gen_c4v7.md>)
“If you do well, will you not be lifted up? But if you do not do well, sin is crouching at the door; and its desire is for you, but you must rule over it.”
### Qayin Kills Havel
#### 8  [gen\_c4v8](<../../notes/genesis/chapter 4/gen_c4v8.md>)
And Qayin spoke to Havel his brother. And it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Qayin rose up against Havel his brother and killed him.
#### 9  [gen\_c4v9](<../../notes/genesis/chapter 4/gen_c4v9.md>)
And YHWH said to Qayin, “Where is Havel your brother?” And he said, “I do not know. Am I my brother’s keeper?”
#### 10  [gen\_c4v10](<../../notes/genesis/chapter 4/gen_c4v10.md>)
And He said, “What have you done? The voice of your brother’s bloods[^1] cries out to Me from the ground.”
### Qayin's Curse
#### 11  [gen\_c4v11](<../../notes/genesis/chapter 4/gen_c4v11.md>)
And now, cursed are you from the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother’s bloods from your hand.
#### 12  [gen\_c4v12](<../../notes/genesis/chapter 4/gen_c4v12.md>)
When you work the ground, it shall no longer yield its strength to you. A wanderer and a fugitive you shall be in the earth.
#### 13  [gen\_c4v13](<../../notes/genesis/chapter 4/gen_c4v13.md>)
And Qayin said to YHWH, “My punishment is too great to bear.”
#### 14  [gen\_c4v14](<../../notes/genesis/chapter 4/gen_c4v14.md>)
Behold, You have driven me out this day from the face of the ground, and from Your face I shall be hidden. And I shall be a wanderer and fugitive in the earth, and it shall come to pass, whoever finds me shall slay me.
#### 15  [gen\_c4v15](<../../notes/genesis/chapter 4/gen_c4v15.md>)
And YHWH said to him, “Therefore, whoever slays Qayin, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold.” And YHWH set a sign upon Qayin, lest anyone finding him should strike him.
### Qayin Dwells in the Land of Nod
#### 16  [gen\_c4v16](<../../notes/genesis/chapter 4/gen_c4v16.md>)
And Qayin went out from the presence of YHWH, and he dwelt in the land of Nod, east of Eden.
#### 17  [gen\_c4v17](<../../notes/genesis/chapter 4/gen_c4v17.md>)
And Qayin knew his wife, and she conceived and bore Chanokh. And he was building a city, and he called the name of the city after the name of his son — Chanokh.
#### 18  [gen\_c4v18](<../../notes/genesis/chapter 4/gen_c4v18.md>)
And to Chanokh was born Irad. And Irad fathered Mechuyael. And Mechuyael fathered Metushael. And Metushael fathered Lamekh.
### The Descendants of Lamekh
#### 19  [gen\_c4v19](<../../notes/genesis/chapter 4/gen_c4v19.md>)
And Lamekh took for himself two wives: the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the second was Tzillah.
#### 20  [gen\_c4v20](<../../notes/genesis/chapter 4/gen_c4v20.md>)
And Adah bore Yaval: he was the father of those who dwell in tents and have livestock.
#### 21  [gen\_c4v21](<../../notes/genesis/chapter 4/gen_c4v21.md>)
And the name of his brother was Yuval: he was the father of all those who handle the harp and the pipe.
#### 22  [gen\_c4v22](<../../notes/genesis/chapter 4/gen_c4v22.md>)
And Tzillah—she also bore Tubal-Qayin, forger of every cutting instrument of bronze and iron. And the sister of Tubal-Qayin was Naʿamah.
#### 23  [gen\_c4v23-24](<../../notes/genesis/chapter 4/gen_c4v23-24.md>)
And Lamekh said to his wives, Adah and Tzillah:  
“Hear my voice, wives of Lamekh;  
give ear to my saying:  
For I have slain a man for wounding me,  
and a young man for bruising me.
#### 24
If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold,  
then Lamekh seventy and sevenfold.”
### The Birth of Shet
#### 25  [gen\_c4v25-26](<../../notes/genesis/chapter 4/gen_c4v25-26.md>)
And Adam knew his wife again, and she bore a son and called his name Shet: “For Elohim has appointed me another seed in place of Havel, because Qayin killed him.”
#### 26
And to Shet also there was born a son, and he called his name Enosh. Then it was begun to call upon the Name of YHWH.

[^1]: “Bloods” (Heb. _d’mei_) is plural — reflecting not only Abel’s blood, but the extinguished generations he would have fathered. The phrase carries legal and covenantal weight, implying both personal and generational loss.
