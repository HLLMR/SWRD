# The First Book of Moses, Called Genesis  
## Chapter 1  
### The Creation
#### 1  
In the beginning, Elohim created the heavens and the earth.
#### 2  
Now the earth had become formless and void, and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of Elohim hovered over the face of the waters.
### The First Day
#### 3  
And Elohim said, “Let there be light,” and there was light.
#### 4  
And Elohim saw the light, that it was good; and Elohim divided the light from the darkness.
#### 5  
And Elohim called the light Day, and the darkness He called Night. And there was evening and there was morning — the first day.
### The Second Day
#### 6
