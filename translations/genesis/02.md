## Chapter 2 
### The Creation of Man
#### 1  [[gen_c2v1]]
These are the generations of the heavens and the earth when they were created — in the day that YHWH Elohim made the earth and the heavens.
#### 2  [[gen_c2v2]]
And every shrub of the field was not yet in the earth, and every herb of the field had not yet sprung up—for YHWH Elohim had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was no man to till the ground.
