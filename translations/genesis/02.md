# Scroll of the Heavens and the Earth
## Chapter 2 
### The Creation of Man
#### 1  [[gen_c2v1]]
These are the generations of the heavens and the earth when they were created — in the day that YHWH Elohim made the earth and the heavens.
#### 2  [[gen_c2v2]]
And every shrub of the field was not yet in the earth, and every herb of the field had not yet sprung up—for YHWH Elohim had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was no man to till the ground.
#### 3  [[gen_c2v3]]
And a mist went up from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.
#### 4  [[gen_c2v4]]
Then YHWH Elohim formed the man from the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and the man became a living being.
### The Garden of Eden
#### 5  [gen_c2v5](gen_c2v5.md)
And YHWH Elohim planted a garden in Eden, in the east; and there He placed the man whom He had formed.
#### 6  [gen_c2v6](../../notes/genesis/chapter 2/gen_c2v6)
And YHWH Elohim caused to sprout from the ground every tree desirable in appearance and good for food, and the Tree of Life in the midst of the garden, and the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil.
