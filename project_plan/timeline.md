## 🧭 TWO MODES OF TIME NAVIGATION

### 1. 📆 **Calendar View**

_For short-term orientation — like Torah calendars, feast planning, study cycles._

**Ideal for:**

- Monthly/weekly layouts
    
- Clicking on “Passover” to view its linked verse
    
- Showing Sabbaths and Jubilee markers
    
- Reading plans (e.g., Day 14 of Omer count)
    

**UI Suggestion:**

- Classic month grid with toggles:
    
    - View by **Lunar**, **Jubilees**, or **Gregorian**
        
    - Overlay **Feast Days**, **Events**, **Reading Plan**
        
    - Click a day → show verses/events under it
        

📦 Uses:  
`calendar_months`, `calendar_days`, `feast_days`, `reading_plans`, `verse_links`

### 2. 📜 **Timeline View**

_For long-term orientation — genealogy, prophecy, history, and AM tracking._

**Ideal for:**

- Visualizing all events from AM 1 to AM 6000
    
- Highlighting Flood, Babel, Exodus, Messiah, 70th Week
    
- Showing prophecy overlaps
    
- Displaying Daniel’s 70 Weeks or Revelation’s 42 months
    

**Challenges:**

- Zooming + scrolling needed
    
- Space gets tight post-AM 3000

## 🧭 REFRAMING THE TIMELINE: A KINGDOM WAR JOURNAL

> This is not just a biblical timeline. This is **His story**.

---

## 📱 MOBILE-FRIENDLY STRATEGY

We want a timeline that:

- **Works vertically** (native scrolling)
    
- **Scales from Adam to 2025**
    
- **Expands or collapses by era**
    
- **Links back to verses, events, and calendar**

## 🎯 SOLUTION: ERA-BASED TIMELINE WITH COLLAPSIBLE CENTURIES

### 📐 Structure:

Each **era or century** becomes a **collapsible block**:

markdown

CopyEdit

▾ AM 0–1000: Adam to Noah
    - AM 1: Adam created
    - AM 130: Seth born
    - AM 930: Adam dies
    - AM 1556: Noah's sons born
    ...

▸ AM 1001–2000: Tower of Babel to Abraham
    [+] 4 events

You scroll vertically, and tap/collapse century bands or milestones.

### 🧭 Proposed ERAS (flexible)

|Era|Range|Tag|
|---|---|---|
|Edenic Age|AM 0–1656|Pre-Flood|
|Patriarchs|AM 1656–2500|Babel → Abraham|
|Israelite Formation|AM 2500–4000|Egypt → Judges|
|Messianic Age|AM 4000–4033|Ministry of Yeshua|
|Age of the Beast|AM 4033–6000|Rome → now|
|Restoration Era|AM 6001+|Millennial Reign (future events)|

You can fill the thin areas (like pre-flood or post-apostolic) with:

### ✅ Post-Biblical, Doctrinally Significant Events:

|Year|Event|
|---|---|
|325 AD|Council of Nicaea (Rome inserts itself)|
|382 AD|Jerome completes Latin Vulgate|
|1054 AD|Great Schism|
|1517 AD|Protestant Reformation|
|1611 AD|KJV published|
|1947 AD|Qumran caves discovered|
|1967 AD|Israel regains Jerusalem|
|2020+|Great Reset, revival of Babel systems|

> You control which ones appear and can tag them with categories:  
> `apostasy`, `restoration`, `prophecy`, `censorship`, `preservation`

---

### 📱 How This Works on Mobile:

- Swipe down = scrolls time
    
- Tap "▾" = opens a century or scroll band
    
- Timeline nav bar lets you **jump to era or scroll**
    
- Pinch/zoom could collapse or expand the event density

## 🧰 Implementation Ideas

- Vertical timeline = native scroll, no horizontal scrolling pain
    
- Start with **AM 1 to AM 6000**, grouped by:
    
    - Millennia → Centuries → Events
        
- Each event links to:
    
    - 📖 Verse (if scriptural)
        
    - 🕊 Feast (if on calendar)
        
    - 📜 Scroll (if in Enoch, Jubilees, etc.)
        
    - 🧠 Commentary (if agent-tagged)
        
- Add “Era Toggle” (Patriarchs / Apostolic / Modern)
