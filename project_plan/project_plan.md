### üß± RESTORED STRUCTURE

#### üî§ Translation Abbreviation System

SWRD is the name of the full project, but not an ideal spoken or printed abbreviation for translation editions. To align with the brand while improving usability and memorability, we adopt the following model:

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|Abbreviation|Full Name|Purpose & Audience|
|**RAW**|Restored Authorized Word|The core literal 1:1 edition; uncompromising, includes all books|
|**REV**|Restored English Version|Smooth, accessible for everyday use and reading aloud|
|**RST**|Restored Scriptures Translation|For academic, interlinear, or formal presentation|

Future variations (e.g., study versions, simplified readers, etc.) will follow this pattern using the `R**` prefix.

Each of these editions will appear as a row in the `sources` table and inherit from the SWRD canonical structure. Schema fields like `restored_chapter_number`, `restored_verse_number`, and `restored_order` reflect the corrected structure used throughout the SWRD project.
